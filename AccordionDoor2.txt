Seems fair, But is foul
Seems fair, And is fair
Seems foul, But is fair
Stone Tablet
The dragon is the foe of old. Never trust the lies he told
He is not what he seems. The enemy of old. A murderer from the beginning
Narrow is the road that leads to salvation
Broad is the road that leads to damnation
The dark man is a demon spirit
Our sin brought him here
This place is sealed. None may enter
