Edward: Hahah, go on... What happened next?
PC: The whole store was surrounded with agents, and well we got caught but in the end we managed to escape their clutches!
Edward: You know this is a really good idea for a movie or, or a book! (general laughter)
PC: ...I think it is best the machine doesn't work. We should not be able to alter the past. Our duty is to make the future better.
PC: I mean, you wished, you prayed it to be that way... In my dream. He said something after that.
PC: ...Not to dwell too much in the past. Rather attempting to repair what you can for the future.

Agent: Their experiment was a failure, shall we move to our next target?
A voice: No, we are staying on target. They are in possesion of informations which I am interested in.
Mr. Crimson: We will attack at the break of night.
