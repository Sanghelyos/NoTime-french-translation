Crimson: Ah yes... Sir Edward Athors  esteemed collegue.  We will talk about your  friend later. You know me already, I guess right?
Crimson: Yes I know a good deal about you and your inventor friend. Me and Edward have known each other for years now, you know.
Crimson: See the reason we knew you were coming is because I was warned.
Crimson: Who warned us? Well let me see it was back in the late 70s
Crimson: I was doing my regular stroll through the outskirts of town, where the old landmark once stood.
Crimson: And suddenly I managed to catch a message sent through time. It was a capsule sent through a time machine in cases of emergency.
Crimson: I was told about everything. About your friend being stuck in 300 BC with them. Whom you eventually turned up to save, but not me...
Crimson: Putting two and two together I found out that this landmark was your doing, well in the far past. I extracted what knowledge I could obtain out of it...
Crimson: Funny thing but a part of our research went into the wind since you delivered us a perfectly working time core...
Crimson: Yes, your little endeavour  to stop my rescue plan.  Well...
Crimson: It is over, you'll be taken care of.
