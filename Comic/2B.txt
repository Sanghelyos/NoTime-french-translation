Crimson: Ah, long have I waited. Sir Edward Athor's esteemed collegue. But where is Edward? I need to speak with him. (Pauses) You can call me Mr. Crimson.
Crimson: You came here for the time machine did you not? Yes, I know of its use. I am sorry you were held against your will.
Crimson: I am the head of CCORP, one of the greatest humanitarian organisations in the world. We care for all people in all their facades.
Crimson: I have helped the smart and truely good people of Pine Lake and gave them a chance to survive. And to be the first to use our new technological systems.
Crimson: I gave them all what was in their right. They see what you cannot yet see. They understand what you do not... yet.
Crimson: You will have to take the mark of our unity and comeradery. You will learn that people have a right for boundless freedom, no moral restrictions. But for the necessity of population control, for the survival of our race.
Crimson: It would only benefit you. It will enhance you in what you are lacking! It is just about the size of a ricecorn, but it would give you possibilities uncountable.
Crimson: Will you join us in changing this world for the better?
