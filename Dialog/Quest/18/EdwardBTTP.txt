(Excited) Huh! Hello there! I am E. R. Athor, inventor! Are you here for repairs? Or are you perhaps in the need of a scientific consultation?
Wait, we had this alread...
(Breaks you off) Hey WAIT A SECOND, you look familiar... Have we met before?... Bah! I am joking buddy. So back already? How did that internship in switzerland go. Anyway I could actually use your assistance!
(Excited) Huh! Hello there!
Wait, I got to tell...
(Breaks you off again) We'll have plenty of time to talk later, I'm afraid this takes precedence!
Huuh (sigh).
(Pauses) What is it?
Did we like, work together on inventions before?
(Pauses) Are you mad at me or something? I don't understand!
No, no don't take it the wrong way.
So what is it then...
I don't remember anything that happened lately.
Oh... I am sorry buddy. At least you do remember me (chuckling) Am I right?
Ok so in short. I am a time traveller.
Oh...
Yeah..
...So how hard did you hit your head?
Just meet me somewhere and I'll show you.
...Ah alright... just meet me behind the Courthouse where the parking lot is. This better be something.
Wow is that a Mach3?
Nice car!
This is the time machine.
Is it that what you were doing in Switzerland?
With a nuclear reactor attached to it!
Oh...
You built it!
(Is thinking) I don't remember building a time machine. But something tells me this is legit. (wondering) Like as if I knew.
I did not build this thing though.
You built it! In a possible timeline.
(Is thinking) This is amazing. You know but just to be sure. Show it off for me. Travel some time into the future.
(Sigh) Alright. Are there any energy sources?
Err yes Uranium, Fusion cells, at the local 6/12 if you need some reactors. Very excited for you to show case that time machine. Jump just a short while into the future!
Wow!
I am Back!
Oh boy. W.. Well! Also, that car is able to fly?
Ye.
Oh boy. I knew it. Flying cars in the future. How can I help?
The other you is stuck in like 300 BC!
Okay, so why not go there?
I can't the machine can only go between 1-2030!
Okay, so how can I help in this at all?
You mentioned the machine using a decoder.
Ohkay, hmm I guess we could still somehow override that decoder to work before 1 AD!
Could you?
Yeah! I can make a module, which would override the destination date to 300 bc! Ehr meet me at the lab!
Alright, hey so do you know what date exactly I landed in?
You've sent me a letter!
Oh did I? Do you have it still?
Alright, hey so do you have that message still, you sent me?
Yes I do
Oh? Show me!
No. But you mentioned May 11th.
Aha!
Wow!
So I wrote the letter May 11th?
Ye?
Okay then! I will set the override to exactly that date.
So?
Why not before you arrived or were captured?
Well! If you help me prior to writing the letter, you would prevent you from ever receiving it. Resulting in a major deviation in the timeline I reckon.
Ok.
Trust me on that one. Otherwise you would never come here and ask me for help in the first place, right? It is better we let things go their course.
How can I help.
I'd need a spare circuit board! Can you get me that?
So what now?
Get some provision. I don't know what will await you but it is better that you are prepared. Also get maybe a lamp or something, it may get dark there at night. Then meet me back again at the parking lot!
Yes here!
Awesome! Ok! All made and ready!
So all ready?
All ready.
This is it then. Man this was awesome. Now to the chip. Take it. Plug it into the input panel and have the dates reset. From there on you are on your own. It was nice meeting you buddy. Will miss you.
Meet me at the parking lot with the time machine!
So this is it then!
Hey no worries.
(Pauses) Ok.
One more thing. What about that courthouse.
(Pauses) hmm? What do you mean. Does it not look like, where you came from?
Well ye. Who is mayor btw?
Ah our good old Mr. Crimson. He has done alot in terms of technological advancements and so on.
(Blank stare) Cr...
Ye. Everything fine?
Nevermind that now. First we save you!
In the past! Ok here is the chip. Just put it into the slot and all should work from there. See you in the future!
You mean in the past!
Haha! ...err(falls into thought) Anyway Goodbye!
Incredible!
Wow!
Hostile natives?!
