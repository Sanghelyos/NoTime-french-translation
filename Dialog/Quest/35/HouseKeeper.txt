Hello master.
Master?
Yes, master.
Ok, who are you? Where am I?
Who I am? The House Keeper. And this is your save house. Consider it a little gift from our common FRIEND. (Nods)
Edward?
(Cross) No, not edward! (Sighs) My apologies master, you don't understand do you? You will in time.
Well, tell me at least something to begin with.
This house here has been given to you, to aid in your late adventures across time. You can leave your posession here, they won't get lost. You can rest here and listen to some of music. Our mutual FRIEND takes great care that you follow his hints so keep an eye out for it.
Butler, can you play me a tune?
Yes master, take a seat at the lounge.
Good luck Master.
