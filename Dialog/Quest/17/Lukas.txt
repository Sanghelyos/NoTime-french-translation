(Sad sigh) Huh. Yes?
Why so sad?
Ah well... I don't know if I should even tell at this point.
You can tell me anything.
Well it is about her.
Oh.
Ye.
..Who?
Well Sandy. She works in that icecream shop just across the square.
You want to ask her out?
(Loweres his voice) I mean yes.
Well why don't you just ask her?
I thought about making a nice present of sorts that would fit her.
Can't you think of anything?
I can...
Well what is it?
A flower...
Like one flower?
No it is a special one. It is called the Elanor.
How do you get it?
Well seemingly everybody tells me I should stop dreaming. This particular plant is extinct for hundreds of years now. I know I can find one. I will have to just search really, (pauses) really hard.
I think you should move on to something else.
Well thanks. It isn't anyway as if the everyone told me otherwise.
I think I can help.
W... Really?
Sure!
Oh great! Thank you. Hmm I think you can look at the book store just next to the mechanic. Get that flowerbook and see if it can help you. Thanks.
(Hopeful) So did you find something out? Do you have the flower? If you do, please show it.
(Ecstatic) No way!
Yes way!
Ok I don't know where you happened to find this but... Thank you. Man. Now I should ehr talk to ... her right?
Wow!
Yes!
(Hesitant) Ok huh. I don't know.
I took care of the impossible, you go talk to her.
(Building up courage) Ok! Hey can you follow and back me up? Like not too close but also not too far away. Just in case. Like at the door.
Alright!
No worries. You can do it.
I can do it! Well follow me! But remember, once I'm there back me up... at a safe distance!
Follow me!
