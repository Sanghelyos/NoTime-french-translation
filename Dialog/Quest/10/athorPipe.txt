It is me Edward!
My head.
I am sorry buddy. Well now we are in a fix.
Hey!
What happened?
I don't remember either. Only thing I know is I woke up in this cell.
Where are we.
Seems to me like a makeshift prison. Let us hope we are not too far from town.
When are we
(Sighs) I can't tell. I guess our time, maybe. Though I really don't recall this place.
What about the car.
I am sure they did not just leave it. It is probably well guarded right now.
How do we escape?
(Whispers) Well lucky me I picked the guards key. Is there any opening on your side?
Yes there is.
(Whispers) Alright! Let me throw it to you.
(Echoes) Ah, BOOGERS!
Hey are you wake ? Hello? Answer!
Shut it!
(Whispers) It is me Edward!
