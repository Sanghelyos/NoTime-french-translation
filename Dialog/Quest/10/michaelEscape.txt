Hey! Who are you?
Just some guy...
Oh really? Just some guy. Well I wonder because you look like one of those who got taken away by the agents. (Pauses) Don't worry, we won't give you away.
I escaped from the prison.
I thought as much... You look like a prisoner to me... Well don't worry, we won't give you away. We might sell you, but we won't hurt you or anything. (stares at you).
So.
...
(Explodes in laughter) Bahaha! I am just joking with you ma fellow! We are not in the dark ages! ... of THE 1970s. Though I think currently it is worse than in the 1970s.
What happened in the 1970s?
(Sighs) Vatican II...
Alright.
(Solemn) Alright.
So err.
Why are you here?! How did you escape prison?
Thank you.
Can you just tell me why they put you in there in the first place? And how did you escape?
It's a long story. Edward picked the keys.
Who is Edward?
We got seperated.
Alright.
He is the other guy with me.
Alright then, no issue there. We could need a couple of hands here! (Chuckles).
The agents stole something important.
Well no wonder. They have been doing this for some time now. The only way to get them is barred.
What do you mean?
The flood gates, which allowed us to enter into the town without being seen have been sealed magnetically. No way around it. We tried it with force but these doors are too thick! Besides you will barely have any luck up there in City I.
So there is no way out then?
Unless you guys got any ideas you would not be able to enter.
The doors are too strong you say.
...
Do you?
We got a microwave but we don't have a magnetometer around. They are illegal.
So is there an illegal way to get it?
Yes there is one.
Are you?
I give you my word we are no spies.
Jason, young fellow. I know this makes no sense but I have a feeling it is the right thing to trust them. If you really need a magnetometer you can ask him to get it. You need a second man anyway. (Turns to you) Speak with jason if you are ready. Afterwards you can help your friend with his idea. What ever he needs a microwave for.
Yes?
Do you have resources to spare.
To the left you can find our cook. And the smuggler we were talking about of course. Hey why not stop at our small chapel, while at it! It is right in the next room behind the kitchen!
What happened here?
You mean this island? I guess you are not from here, not much news comes through to the outside world. Well let's just say that the big guy has messed alot of things up for us. It is quite an earnest topic. I am sure Jason will tell you more later.
Why is the weather so dark?
The ATMO Exchange.
Once you are in town. About the inhabitants who are up there. Do not trust them.
Why ist that?
(Cautious) They have been turned. They sadly are lost. Their old self gone. They will not be friendly towards you. Believe me we tried to converse with them, and save them, to what ever the consul did to them. We tried.
Yes, I think I encountered some of them earlier.
(Cautious) Then you know already... They sadly are lost. Their old self gone. They will not be friendly towards you. Believe me that we tried to retreive their old self. Revert what the consul did to them. We tried.
That is all really.
Thank you for the advice.
(Hopeful) Good Luck up there. And we will pray that you will get through safe. We will pack our things now as well. Things are getting heated. It was very nice meeting you.
Good luck. Oh, one thing.
Well now at any rate they know this is a secret hide out! Thanks to you telling them. (Stares at Jason).
(Distracted) ...Is that him? ...Well, we ...we could use a couple hands here.
