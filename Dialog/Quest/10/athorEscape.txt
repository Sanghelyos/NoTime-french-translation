This cannot be our time! Some distant future maybe. I don't know.
Pinch me please! This must be just some bad dream...
I bet that tower is where our time machine is being kept! It would have been very unlikely, that they did not take it as well.
Where is that stench coming from?
(Looks at the ominous view to the north) Pretty sure we are not gonna go that way...
Check if the way ahead is clear.
Are you alright?!
Well boogers, that complicates everything even more.
Well, I err guess you have to go on without me!
I will find a way, we will meet each other in the sewers! That way we will sneak into the city safely.
Wait... I hear something approaching!
Move!
Anyway... Let's find another way out then! Follow me!
HEY, I said be quiet! Alright that's it!
The key, in the pipes!
Quick open the door with the key! Attack!
Good job! Get your items from their guard room and let us escape!
Where are we? When are we?! This is the schools sport yard!
(Whispers) Ok quick pause, I think the school will probably lead us outside. In the worst case we might have to take the sewers...
Let's take the school.
Quick then! Follow me!
The sewers it is.
Right after you then! The manhole is right next to the schools side entrance.
Quick.
What! Where is the exit?
(Whispers) We have to retreive our time machine. Who ever these agents are, they are up to no good. They already may be using the machine for some evil plan as we speak!
Let's get going. There has to be a way in.
Quick then!
Can you check if the way ahead is clear?
Go on, I will find another way.
We better move quick! Before they get wind of us missing.
Do you know how to navigate here?
(Sudden earnestnes) As a youngling ventured into the sewers. So ready?
All ready?
Do have a spare flashlight?
You are lucky, yes I always keep a spare flashlight with me.
Yes let us go
Alright! Let us go!
Alright this is the exit to the bridge. I give you the honor.
(Whispers) Quick follow me.
(Shocked) What! What is this! What happened here!?
What happened here?
Must be the wrong year.
Pinch me! This has to be some bad dream... One is certain. I bet the timemachine is in that high building. They may be using it already for their plans.
Hmm?
Let us get it then.
We can't simply walk in there. It is likely too well guarded.
We must get in!
We just escaped. They know who we are! We can't just go to them and ask them nicely to give the car back to us.
We take the sewers.

(Earnest) There is no other way then.
Boogers! I don't remember this blockade. Let us take the long way around.
Two ways. Which way now?!
We will have to split ways!
You know this never goes well.
This is not a movie buddy. Come on you take the left I take the one straight up
Alright.
Let's stick together.
(Sighs) Alright... what ever.
Good! If you find the way meet me back here.
Lead the way!
Ah hey there.
Great entrance you did there.
(Apologeticly) I did what I could.
I got a magnetometer.
(Ecstatic) You do! That solves at least one of our problems.
All ready?
Yes let's get started.
(Cautious) Stay behind me.
Alright then let us go.
(Whispers) Alright we are now entering the city. Be on your guard.
The laser broke...Well at least the door is free.
I could figure something out. All I need would be hard to get by. You guys don't have a magnetometer and a microwave?
Arrgh! (pauses) Hi.
If we get caught again I bet you that it won't be as easy next time around. (pauses) What is that? You hear it?
Run to the sewers!
The sewers. Quick!
So.
(Whispers) Hmm no way out through the entrance. To the left I know a way!
