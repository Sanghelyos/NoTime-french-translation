 (I challange you!)
 (Me Igor? Hahaha, you will try.)
 (Can I see your helmet?)
 (Ah I see that you are impressed by my mighty head dressing, here take a look.)
 (Enough, ENOOUGH!)
 (Enough, you win!)
 (Did I?)
 (Yes! Now please can I have my helmet back, so I can go tell Ragnar, that you won)
 (Thank you!)
 (Fight me COWARD!)
 (STOP RUNNING!)
 (COWARD!)
 (I will not fight a coward like you, face me next time... instead of evading!)
 (Give me my helmet back!)
