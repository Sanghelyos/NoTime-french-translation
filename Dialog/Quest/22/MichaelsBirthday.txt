Got the ingredients ready? And a Mr. Crafty? Place them on the table!
Yes here they are!
Ok I put together the recipe! Here!
Yes here is the cake!
Uh, you were fast! Didn't even need the recipe did ya? (Pauses) Lemme take the cake! Meet me at the Main Square. We may be just in time for the party.
Awesome! I think we are ready for the birthday party!
Alrighty then!
Lemme take the cake! Meet me at the Main Square. We may be just in time for the party.
Really? What is this? You want me to present to him a half eaten birthday cake!
Place the cake on the table once finished.
Hey!
I am here!
Finally! Let's talk to Michael.
...
Hey, everything alright?
(Sick) Why... oh, why did it have to be poobrew!
What?
I have been drinking Cococrab Gold Nuggets! All that time!
Come on that happens.
No?! You gave me that stuff to make me feel better. (Disgusted sigh).
Now wait, it is not my fault.
Oh... sure what ev...(Turns into the distance).
Boogers! He went upstairs... There are bandits here. Lead on!
Go back to Michael! I will escort the agent into town!
Go to Michael. He needs to know!
I will escort the agent into town! Go tell Michael! Don't worry about me... I will take care of the rest!
Hello!
What is it? Where have you guys been?
We caught an agent spying.
An agent? One of these masked men we saw earlier? Where is he? In that case let us bring him down to the Under City, for safe keeping. We need to question him. We will meet you down there!
What is it? Where have you guys been?
Edward is bringing him into town.
In that case let us lead him down to the Under City, for safe keeping. We need to question him. We will meet you down there.
Meet us in the Under City... It is in the sewers beneath the church!
Meet us in the Under City... It is in the sewers beneath the church!
The agent is inside the room behind the kitchen... He must not blow our cover, as to being time travellers!
He won't. Are you better now?
(Sighs) I guess, I need to forget it, as if it never happened. Here comes michael...
...
What was that agent saying?
What do you mean he knows?
Ah. Crimson told him about you of course... Back in the 80s already!
What did you mean in the 80s?
That does not matter. All that matters is, that you will soon be dead! Once our great leader has the CORE, all will be branded with a chip in order to survive, seemingly... until he kills them of course. And you will be dead first. (Malicious) HAHAHAHAHA!
What now?
We will have to take the CORE.
...
To the lab already!
Meet me at the lab!
Take the CORE? We alone... this is madness!
MADNESS?
THIS... IS...
All that is left that we can do. Unless you want their great leader to take it first. Anyway soon their leader will be here so what will it be pray?
This is it then. We take the CORE! Jason you will help them. I want to hear a plan soon...
(Sighs) Alright. In this case, good bye wonderful world. Let's meet back at E.R. Athors run down laboratory.
Well not what I asked for my birthday. But we got to move forward.
Let's meet back at the lab.
(Scoffs) Oh try, you will die anyway
Quiet. Your great lordling won't act anyway as long as he awaits your return.
You brought him down here Edward? Right?
Yes, behind the kitchen... let us go!
You have a lot to explain!
(Chuckles)
Why in the world are your eyes glowing? What's wrong with you?!
Why have you been spying out our settlement, who are you?
(Hums a random tune)
Answer!
Will you answer!?
(Hesitant) n.. noo?
Do you know how to spelling of Good Bye!? Answer already!
Nooo! Please stop it! I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING... (Breathes heavily).
I am spying out the regions on behalf of our great Leader.
AHA! The great leader? (Mumbles) Crimsons great leader?
B... before he engages the full invasion that is...
The great leader?
I wonder if it is the same, that Crimson has mentioned (Breaks off and coughs) ...back, when he lived.
Aye Crimson was his henchman. He likely died during the 1990 incident.
The great leader goes around first as a man of peace as they say. Then he strikes. Originally first words of him came from jerusalem.
It seems no matter the timeline (Breaks off) err, thin line... that leader goes around taking over the world.
Why has this place been targeted for invasion.
The CORE of course!
The CORE!
If our Leader has the CORE, he will easily take over the rest of THE WORLD! (Laughs maliciously).
Then he will have it easy killing one after the next. Including this so called Remnant, these stubborn closeminded church goers!
Hmm where have I heard that before?
Oh our leader knows about you fully well...
(Looks cornered and uncomfortable)
--------------------------------------
Michael, Happy Birthday! ...We made you something today as well! A cake!
A cake! Thank you! Where did you get strawberries from? Or eggs, or anything at that point?
(Pauses) We had some... spare ingredients left in the car... where we came from.
(Interested) Alright... (Chuckles)
Aye!
Sit down and let me serve you all a piece!
Take a seat buddy!
(Pauses) Lord, bless this cake by thy holy will... in the name of Jesus Christ Amen!
Amen!
...Amen
(Pauses) you know... Tom I think you will have a new cook in the kitchen...
(Starts singing)
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday to YOUUU!
You may be getting older...
But so are your friends TOO!
(Pauses) Thanks.
Let us have some ale and dance!
Come on let us dance!
That is some good ale!
Yeah! Tastes like motor oil... but it's Good!
Hey, what's your favorite drink btw?
Coffee!
Aye coffee is good. My parents told me bardeys was the place, they always went to in order to get some nice coffee.
Oh really?
He had special recipe for the perfect coffee.
...
(Shouts) Yeah! And good thing I never tasted it!
Well, what was in it?
Cococrab Dung!
What? What did I say?
Why does he always get upset when I say something?
----------
(Shouts into the distance) Hey man!

Looks like a time agent...
Walks like one...
Runs like one of them! GET HIM!
He is running for that industrial complex!
Stop we need to talk to you!
What?! In the WORLD IS THAT?!
