Why is this whole island a desert?
Man. Not only this island but a good chunk of the world...
How?
It was New Years Eve 1989 (Pauses) just to the west of this island, in the ocean, there was a massive impact.
We were guessing, a nuclear strike first, later we thought maybe it was a meteor impact. I remember when I was a kid, it was like a gigantic earthquake and then loads and loads of mushroom clouds on the horizon.
That made us hide quickly in the underground sewer system. Cape Dun, the whole western side. It just, went gone in an instant. We got later wind from wandering folk, that this event was interpreted by the continent as an act of war.
This sent the rest of the world into a frenzy of nuclear fire, a short but world wide war. You see this was the event which transported the world into a second ice age for a decade.
While all this was happening, and we were hiding underneath the city for shelter, the CORE rose up.
An automated defense system made by Crimson Industries ordered around by an administrator named P.E.N.
We don't know who he is or what his intentions are, but so far his decisions have been rather passive aggressive.
No one has ever seen him as of yet so one can only wonder who he is.
What ever happened to him, but his system is still operating.
...and apparently under the control of an administrator, nicknamed P.E.N.
(Mumbles) Crimson...
Anyway. Hey, there is this abandoned shack just at the southern part of the Town Square. That one with the glowing holographic sign. You can take it for now...
Thank you Michael. (Turns to you) I need to take a break inside the church if you need me.
Jason, you were talking about some sightings with masked men?
Yeah.
Hold off with that until we get everything set and ready (Turns to you).
Go and check after your buddy first, I will catch up with you later.

So what I was going to say earlier...
...There have been sightings of masked men with glowing eyes in the past days.
(Shouts) What da heck Is going on here!?
We were talking...
What day is it? The date!
What YEAR?!
...
 man.
 (Sighs) Why? Have we invented this dreaded machine?
Hey can I have talk a with you?
(Sighs of desparation)
