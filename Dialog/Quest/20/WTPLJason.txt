Yeah?
Michael told me to help you out.
Did he? You seem to have made friends already. I guess that is just his trusting character. Did he have a right feeling about you, or something?
So what do you need?
Well... as you may guess we are always in need of provisions. We do need at least 5 units of food. Anything you can find really. But please no soup. We have enough soup from Tom. I will be at the storage area, if you need me. Right below the reactor.
--- keep a space after the thank you very much ---
Aye some meat. You were hunting? Did you make a geiger counter check? 
Donut? Where in the world do you get fresh donuts from? 
Burger. You took your time prepearing it. 
Soup? Ohh I aksed you not to get any soup. Alright nevermind. 
Bisque... Mhm.  
Wha.. What are Chips n Sticks? 
Pizza.. Not bad. How did you get that? 
Ye olde Snack. They can last ages... 
Soda Perfect?! Wooow... 
Have you gotten the provisions yet? Place them on the table.
I got the food you needed.
Alright let us see.
 Thank you very much!
Where should I search?
You could go and scavenge the surrounding area, if there is anything left to find. Some of the old ruins might still have some valuable stuff.Though stay away from the old industrial complex in the north. It's not worth it, too many bandits walking around there. Watch out though, there is this sand monster ravaging around.
What happened to this place?
What do you mean? It looks ok to me? I mean I have heard of worse shelters around, some with no electricity or even worse. No working sewers, eww.
Where can I find ressources?
Ressource? Like energy cells? Or soup? Boxes or other things?. I the Under City should have what you need. It is in the sewers but watch out for the bandits. Oh and really, be on your guard. Especially for the giant coco crabs! They give you quite a pinch! And there are still these sewer cats....
Hi.
So what is next?
Well first, here is some payment for your hardships.
Thanks.
Michael should be by the barracks right now. I will go talk to him, meanwhile see if your friend is alright.
Know anything about local ship wrecks?
Err, no, should I? Ask Bernd, he is in the under city, in the sewers. I am sure he will be able to help you out... He used to scout the shores every now and again.
