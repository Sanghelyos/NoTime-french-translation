Know anything about a ship called the Aurora?
Sorry, no clue... err what is it?
A supposed vessel. Know any ship wrecks?
I used to scout the shores many times in my past... Do you know about the ghost ship?
Ghost Ship?
Yes... you know there are these two rocks sticking out of the ocean, off to the north coast. Where that great reef is you know. There at midnight, you can see from the corner of your eye, a ship appearing. Trust me, go there and you will see.
I will, thanks Bernd.
Yes... yes (pauses). You wanna buy a watch?
