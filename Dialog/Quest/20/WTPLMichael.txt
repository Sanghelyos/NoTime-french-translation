Hey. What are you doing here?
This place is specifically for the inquiries. Besides our town center is actually a fission reactor, please do watch out! This car isn't supposed to be here!
Err hey there.
Is your friend hurt?
So.
The natives.. (Pause) we got attacked.
Alright Jason, take him to the quarters... (Freezes) Oh no.... They are coming.
Since you have caused such a hassle, could you maybe help us out. I mean after all we are taking care of your buddy as well and you nearly caused a war on us!
Yeah sorry.
No worries, see everything got settled in the end.
Could you help us out?
So what do you need?
Talk to Jason, he could need some help in a pressing matter. I think he is at the barracks.
Greetings!
What happened to this place?
What? You really are not from this area, are you? Well basically this was, as far as we know, the epicenter of the Incident.
Where can I find the barracks?
Where that old coffee shop was...Ah yeah you haven't been here yet. Well see that old police station at the town square, well just next to it.
This place it seems dangerous.
Well yeah. Bandits behind every corner and that AI watching us all the time. We can't simply leave they would be after us in no time... You're happy that you kind of slid into the grey zone of being able to travel around freely with your weird super car. We don't have that opportunity you know...
He may have some serious memory loss by the looks of it. He acts as if he did not remember anything, that happened in the past 20 years!
Well.
...
Know anything about a ship called the Aurora?
Sorry, got no clue.
Follow me, we need to have this settled before this will get worse.
