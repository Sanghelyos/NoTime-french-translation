So here we are. This place looks terrible!
What's up next?
(Is thinking) Now we need to face the real impossible task at hand. Infiltrating the tower, I guess the courthouse somehow connects to the tower.
Then we need to enter the courthouse, somehow.
(Thinks) We could look for a side entrance. I remember a side door leading into the courthouse, but it may be locked. What do you think?
Let us check it out!
Shhh, alright follow me!
I guess we need a key!
I will find one.
Maybe the guards house is still used. Next to the pizza place, that is if you ever went there in 2014. Search it, oh and stay hidden. I bet these jets are just searching for us.
Can't you use that gun?
Alas something broke when cutting through the gate. I will try to fix it while you look for the key.
You are a marvel. Lead on!
Open the door if you got the key!
Let us find a way into the depths of this building!
(Whispers) The archives! They seem still to be intact! Although, sealed off to the public. This may be the chance for us to find something that could explain all of this! Anything important, see if you find something!
Maybe some of these files could be useful take a look.
Hmm nah.
Nope.
Not useful I guess.
Looks unimportant.
Huh? Seems important! Eh, can I have it?
If we make it out we can inspect these files on our pace. Let's venture on upstairs!
(Speculating) Someone must have consulted a very bad architect.
The machine! But how do we get out?! It is pitch black in here argh! Eh hey do you see that red mechanism up there? To the right! Trigger it!
Well here we are now! Very witty of you earlier by the way... Now we know their entire plan! Good to have you as a companion.
Yeah, a good thing that we survived.
(Cheering up) Yes! Yes! Let us escape with the car! The gate seems to be shut. There has to be a control panel for it somewhere. (Freezes) Do you hear that?
Alright let us see where this way behind that opened gate goes. Lead on!
Let us find a mechanism to open that gate. It has to be somewhere upstairs.
The door to the lever is closed. We need to find a keycard!
Ah there is a lever! But the door is closed! I bet they went up with the keycard!
We need to get that keycard! They got to be upstairs.
A nuke!?
We need to get that keycard! They got to be upstairs!
(Trembling) Steady... I err, just go a tick slower please.
We need to get that keycard! They got to be upstairs.
That Crimson guy is escaping!
See if he had the key!
To the time machine! No time!
Great let us go then!
Now for it!
I will activate the time machine!
We need to get going! I hope the time machine is charged!
Boogers!
I just wanted to let you know you have been a good friend.
Lord have mercy on us.
Let me try and open this gate! Watch out!
Great! Now it broke completely. Let me think (thinks).
There is a way behind that gate! Lemme pick up what is left of my robot first.
(Pauses) Is that my training bot? (shocked) No! What have they done?
Well there is only one thing left to do then.
--BOSS NAME---
TRAINING BOT
He has some kind of shield. (Thinks) Do you see these generators? Coax him to shoot at them!
(Yells) Watch out I am opening fire!
Watch out!
Watch out! Coax him to target the generators!
Run! He is loading his lasers!
Watch out! Hide!
He is firing! Coax him to target the generators!
