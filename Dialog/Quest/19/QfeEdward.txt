Hah! Hah... (Whispers) you made it... You made it! I guess that input date problem was only a small problem for you.
Your younger self helped me out!
(Whispers) Ah! I see, very smart. As you can see I am in quite a fix. You need to get me out of here!
(Whispers) So...
The time conduction circuit got fried.
Well that is not good at all. (pauses in thought).
...
I have been trying to get some of the technology from the agents. Well that is why I got caught in the first place. The agents portable machines do not function on the same hardware though. So retrieving them might not solve this issue. And we can't use them for time travel as their programming is completely ruined due to the virus!
We need a new circuit.
Mr. Crimsons Jet, maybe. You might search for their conduction circuit inside the wreck. It should be likely at the bridge. You need to get it, there is no other way. There is another thing I might need you in.
Aye?
These bars are pretty strong. You will have to break them open via some kind of tool. I left my gun at the friendly tribe, where the old forest is. I left it there because it would hinder me at being sneaky. (Pauses) well.
So should I go to them?
Yes, wait. Here take this an OLOOMOOLOO. It is a token of friendship to them.
OLOOMOOLOO?
Yes. It is a friendly greeting of sorts. I wear it because they gave it to me. I hope this will help you. Now wait.
Yes?
I don't think they will understand a word you say... I have devised plans for a translation unit. So I will give you the plans and you go and make this thing. Without the OLOOMOOLOO they won't talk, without the device you can't understand them. So you need both.
Alright!
Here are the plans. I saw a native guy mess around with my MR.Crafty up at one of the campfires here around. I am sure you might be able to salvage any parts to craft the translator, out of the time jet. Watch out though the reactor might have gotten unstable due to the crash. After you manage that, try to get my laser back! (pauses then whisperes) And then go straight back to me.
Weren't the agents dialed to the future?
They were! But the date was not computable... as expected... It was worth a shot. The future would have been the safest date, thinking that they would likely change the distant past drastically.
How do I use the translation device.
Just have it in your invetory or hold it while you are talking to them. If my calculations are correct the lingual stream would correct the grammatical strings into the right consonants and vowels.
Where is Crimson?
Oh? Down there in the other cage. I think you wont get a healthy conversation out of him. Just leave him to his own spoils.
(Whispers) Quick, Come closer!
(Whispers) So... you need to switch the laser from SAFE, to LETHAL. So it can cut through these bars. We need to hurry.
Alright! Ehr how.
Just press 231...(pauses) Ehr better, oh no behind you!
(Whispers) Look out!
They spotted you! Use the laser!
Alright!
Look out! I err the laser DOES NOT activate!
Why does that fricking Laser not work!
Ahaa!! GOT IT!! Oh...
--BOSS HEALTH--
PLATYPUS BOSS
Watch out!
...
I don't know what just happened.
In that case let us go on. Follow me! Quick there is no time.
Ready?
Lead on!
I will cut through these gates with the laser.
The time travel stuff from the agents has to be somewhere up there. We cannot leave it here.
I will go get it then.
Alright. Meanwhile I will keep watch. Come back safe.
Can I have the gun?
(Sighs) Alright. But don't loose it.
Ah. Give me that bag please!
I will take care of it... and properly dispose it.
I will properly dispose it. Ah can you give me back my laser gun?
Can I have my gun back?
Thanks!
All right!
Let us get going.
Get the car and meet me back at the tribal city, in the old forest. Where my shack is. I need to take with me the other stuff I left behind.
Will you make it safe?
No worries. I have the laser.
All ready?
Yep.
Well in that case where is the car?
Yes it is here.
Well all we would need now is a time conduction chip, crimsons jet definitely has to have one... Get back to me in case you find anything inside it.
Well all we would need now is a time input chip from crimsons jet! Do you have it? Show it!
Excellent!
------------------
Now that this is out of the way.
You seem to learn languages fast.
Well... I simply use the tools given to me. So, is everything set up? Do you need any energy cells? I have some left.
Need energy cells?
I am fine, but thank you.
Well! Alright. Is everything ready?
Got fusion cells?
Alright! Here... Now, is everything ready?
Got any uranium?
Alright! Here... Now, is everything ready?
Ready?
Ready!
Let's get back straight to 
 Back home.
Let's go back home!
Something about the future is different.
What is different?
Oooh. argh just err land at the Pine Lake Square!
Oooh. argh just err stop by the Pine Lake Square!
Voilla. finished! We are ready!
Ohh they hit my head.
(Shouts) Argh! My head.
 (Good bye, headman, friend)
Gadanah Flokomoko Headmanu.
 (Bye, friend)
Bai Flokomoko!
Alrighty! Can't wait to be back home again!
Alright follow me!
Where are all the natives all of the sudden?
Look out! There are more coming!
Quick give me the Laser! I will manage it.
Thanks! Oh Watch out!
...
Ah you are awake..They got you, but I got the laser still!
Did you hear that?
Oh Boogers...
A giant...
Platypus!
Keep that thing away from me!
Distract him!
