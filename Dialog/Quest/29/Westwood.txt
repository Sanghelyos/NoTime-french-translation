Hello Mr. Westwood!
Nothing new pal. I am interrogating this friend behind bars. He may have something to do with the shooting on february 11th.
Where did the shooting take place?
The crime scene took place behind the national bank, February 11th. At the backyard. In between the dark canyons of the domicile homes. In the secrecy of night, probably after 6pm, at night. Do you know anything about it?
I will let you know if I find out anything.
Alright pal, but no vigilante actions here. Alright?
Here, something interesting.
Hmm. Interesting find. I will take the job from here. Thank you for your aid.
Here, is your letter.
I am interested in knowing where you happened to find that note.
I've got an important note for you.
Do you? Place it on the table. Then I'll see if it is important.
I need to know where this ends.
Citizen, that is none of your business. You could get into serious danger. You did well enough as it is right now, and I am thankful. I shall ask you at a later date how you got this to begin with. But for now stay safe.
Thank you detective.
Stay safe pal.
