Meet me on Park Hill!
Strange Man
You got into alot of trouble earlier.
What do you want?
I could need an accomplice in a matter regarding the rampones, and the crimsons.
...
Alright, continue.
You may have read about their meeting in the next few days, this february. I have been following them for some time now, the families meet near Cape Dun. I am pretty sure they will make the event happen on the Roover Dam.
Interesting, but what is the deal here?
They are trying to do a weapons transaction, when they say extra spicy, italian bombs!
Oh boy.
What the rampones don't know, Mr. Crimson wants to blow up the courthouse in pine lake!
What a shocker!
We will need to stop them from doing the transaction!
Who are the Crimsons?
A crime family. I was spying on his mansion at byroad. We need to stop them from doing the transaction.
What could I do?
I could use a decoy!
Oh! Great.
Good! I will be counting on your aid!
No thanks.
You have no choice, I count on your aid in this one. You chose to play with this story, you will need to finish it!
What am I supposed to do?
You will enter their conversation. Then, when they are distracted, I will take them all out. Then we will take their delivery and be on our way.
Ok.
0 in the morning, february 28th. On the roover dam. Just enter in and drive their conversation to your attention! See you there.
Also, who in the world are you?
Who am I? (Looks behind you) Uh what is that? Look!
Why should I look behind me?
(Looks behind you).
Cuz Am COCOCRAB MAN!
I guess the plan worked
Thank you friend! Maybe there stories will be written about this in the future. We will see.
Aye, maybe.
Go now. And if I need you again, I will find you.
