Well.
We meet at last.
You have got the delivery I see.
Yes.
I have to deeply apologize for the incident.
...
Who is this?!
We have been spotted!
Go away. I have no words for you. You are just like unto dirt under my shoes.
What?! You like to look at me in this plight don't you? Well wait for your turn of bad luck to occur.
---------------------------------
What is this talk about?
You are planning to blow the courthouse in pine lake?
Are you?
Yes.
And then it will be easy to take the rest of this island!
Take them out!
NOT if I have something to say!
I need to get out of here!
Not so fast CRIMSON!
Who, who are you. WHO ARE YOU?!
Your worst nightmare!
I'm COCO CRAB MAN!
Good job Coco Crab Man!
The Don escaped. We will need to capture him too. I have enough to put him behind bars.
This will be a small task.
(Turns to you) Thank you stranger for your aid. I see that Coco Crab Man has found a good ally in you.
--------------------------------
Good bye, mister... Any last words which I should note?
Any last words, boy?
RUN!
What? Who said that?
RUUUN!
What?! Get him! He can't escape!
