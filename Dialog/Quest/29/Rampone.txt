NO!
We have a personal note from the Don to your boss.
The delivery was intercepted by the police, we will make amends for it.
...We will make amends for it!
(Fingers on the trigger) You won't get your hands on no one.
What is the name of a good drink?
2canpie...
Enter in!
What was your doing with the shooting?
Dude, I already said. I DON'T KNOW! GO AWAY.
Who are you?! Leave me alone!
What?! Leave me alone! Are you here to kill me as well?!
Let's get this over with!
I am not here to kill you!
Oh, you're not?
I want your note!
No, that is a private message from the don!
Don't have the detective get involved in this.
You are working with him? Now I got problems from both sides. The don will have me dead probably, or I will go to a cell.
Give me the envelope and I will take care.
Alright, here! Now leave me alone, I am already in enough trouble!
Leave me!
Where are you going to head?
None of your business!
Where can I find your boss?
He is at the local speakeasy. But don't get your hopes up champ. For one he has many armed friends, secondly you'd need a password to enter. I won't tell you by the way, I did enough for you already!
