I've got an important note for you.
(Blank stare) Place it on the table then.
Not finished here, yet.
The meeting went bad. A shooting occoured.
I see you were there, when it happened. But you are not of the crimsons, as I can see.
I chose to give you the message back.
I see. You know more than you tell.
...
You may have given me back the personal message, and I see that in your honor you did not open it. But you know too much. I will give you an honorable death.
You may have given me back the personal message, but it was an error on your part to open it. I do not take kindly on people putting their noses were it ought not to be.
Well, seems we meet again! Do you have a death wish son?
I am here to warn you.
You have guts, I have to admit. What do you want to tell me?
Well?
Do not give them this delivery!
Oh really what is inside it? Since you seem to know that much already.
Well?
Look, they want to blow up the courthouse.
What?!
