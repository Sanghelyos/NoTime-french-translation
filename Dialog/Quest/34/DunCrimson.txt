(Sarcastic) Yees... yay.
Lord?! (Yells) Guards! Take these people away! They've poisoned our master!
Guards! I've captured the bandits! Inform the lord that I captured them! Off to prison with them!
Oh... In that case where are these, other bandits, then?
You disappoint me... little hill men.
All you should have done is sit put in your little cells and I might have let you live.
Now I am angry.
(Angered) It is not a pointy hat!
And I am not just some hench man of the local lord here. In fact...
I AM CRIMSON... grandson of the dark sourcerer! And I've come to plot my revenge on the lord and his offspring. And you as well, for your cave is located on a vast amount of gold ore that I have an interest in.
You will be first, for your insolence, to get a taste of my wrath.
All you should have done is get caught by these robbers... Then poisoning the lord could have been averted... to a later date.
(Growls) You miserable lordling. You think you have the upper hand? 
Look here! HAHAHAHA!
Hmm... I've expected this to work better...
GRRR!
