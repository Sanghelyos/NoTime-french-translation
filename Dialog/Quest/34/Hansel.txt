! Who did this to you?
Giants! They are hiding in the trees!
What where...
Well boogers...
(Whispers) EROMBUR! GET OUT THERE ARE GIANTS HIDING...
Well... that problem kind of solved itself.
What now...
I heard some talk of the guards that they are having a party upstairs. Luck has it that the guard next to us had a bottle of wine. 
Sounds like a plan!
Shhh! We might have a chance to do something in this situation. Lemme talk to the Sage!
Hey Sage...
How'd that story continue?
Give me the key... I'll roll the guard out of the way of your door.
Fool! What have you done. Now what?
This will take just a second...
(Whispers) Shush!
(Whispers) EROMBUR WILL YOU BE QUIET!
The entrance is locked... We cannot exit without a key. There is no other way!
Hey! It's that pointy hat hench man from Fort Dun. Hey... who is here the little one huh?
GOLD? HOW!
Wow... What happened after?
What happened to Eduardo?
They are inside, feel free to enter!
