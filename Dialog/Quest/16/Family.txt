(Weeping)
(Stuttering) I want out.
(Consoling the mother) Don't worry it... will be alright. He is strong. We will find him.
Can I help?
We lost our son. He went out to the woods and now he went missing. If you want to help I guess the old Edwin, on the other side of the forest knows more. The police questioned him already... I don't know if you will be able to find out more.
(Weeping) Who... what was that?
I don't know who or what that was.
Thank you. I want home. Can you help me? I think I actually know this place. Please come with me I don't want to go alone.
(Weeping) Can you follow me home?
Alright lead on.
Thank you!
(Weeping) Quick, home isn't far...

Where can I learn more about this accordion man?
Err... well. I suppose you can try it at the town archives of the courthouse in pine lake.
I search the Accordion Man Case!
What? Why? ... I think there was an old document somewhere around. Just get what you need and be on your way!
Hey best friend!

Non Draco Sit Mihi Dux!
Vade Retro... Satana!
Nunquam Suade Mihi Vana!
Sunt Mala Quae Libas!
Ipse Venena... Bibas!
