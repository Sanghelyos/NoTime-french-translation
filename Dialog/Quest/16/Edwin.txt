(Paranoid) Huh! And who are you?!
Just visiting the countryside.
(Stuttering) W... well I advise you not to visit anything here. This place shouldn't be for casual walks ...as it is currently. Not since the strange occurences happened.
(Paranoid) Huh! Y yes s?!
What occurences?
Well.. (loweres his voice) Strange sightings. A kid went missing.
Missing?
Pshhh (loweres his voice) I advise you to be on your guard. It is after sundown and the forest is no place for someone like you.
Pshhh (loweres his voice) I advise you to be on your guard after sundown.
I will get to the bottom of this.
(Stuttering) R really? (pauses) Haven't you heard what people were talking about ...around here?
So where did the strange encounters happen.
There in the forest. Just don't ...please.
So after sundown in the old forest?
W.. well. Thank you for your courage. You need to find that missing kid. But really... Be on your guard for who or what ever is out there. Oh one more thing.
Yes?
Here take this chant. It saved me last time. If there seems to be no way out, just recite it. Oh and take a lamp with you. Really you will need one. Find that kid.
