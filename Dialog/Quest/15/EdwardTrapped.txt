Oh must have turned on by accident...
Oh Boogers! Quick! Activate the robot!
To the antenna follow me!
(Pauses) Now all ready? Step back a bit please...
To business.
What is the next step?
We need to set up the devices. Go and build up the robot! Just ahead there should be the base made from some oven parts. Take the robot head, I placed on the table and put it on top of the construct!
Alright, all is set up? I will take our friends back to their time periods!
I guess this means the end?
Let me set up my time machine. You can exchange some last words.
All ready?
Yes let us begin.
Alright!
Follow me...
Alright! Oh by the way. I managed to repair the laser again! Anyway can we start the trapping virus?
The car will not be affected right?
No not at all. Their devices work all on the same frequency. Ours does not!
Alright! Oh by the way. I managed to repair the laser again! Anyway. let me set a timed activation for the tracker!
Ok let's begin!
Remember! Once the device is ticking I will give you the sign to trigger the robot. Then you follow me straight after! ...Now let me set a timed activation for the tracker!
Go on up hill! I will hold them back. Just activate that antenna!
Quick! Up the hill and activate that antenna!
