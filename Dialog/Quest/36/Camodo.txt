(Mumbles) What a nice view... Hey stranger, Camodo Gordon here! And you are?
I am future... guy!
I am from far a way...
I am... no one.
Yeah I know from the future... yada yada. I was just minding my own business watching birds, taking in the scenery. But now I gotta go, don't follow me!
Yeah I get your drift. Far away, sure. You mean in your TIME MACHINE? I was just minding my own business watching birds, taking in the scenery. But now I gotta go, don't follow me!
Anyway, NO ONE. Or rather, guy who is totally not from the future. I was just minding my own business watching birds, taking in the scenery. But now I gotta go, don't follow me!
, you won't give up will you? (Sighs)
I got to ask, how do you see?
I don't need eyes, my senses are hyper-tuned to my surroundings! Besides, the two letters in front are visual receptors. I got to admire your determination to track me down, for what ever reason that may be.
You apparently know something about me.
(Chuckles) Of course I do, from our common friend.
Edward?
(Cross) No, not Edward! (Sighs) I am sorry... I meant Mim of course.
Ok, and who is Mim?
(Astonished) You, you don't know? I see... you are not at that point where you find out yet...
What?
Listen, the point is... I cannot tell you more at present. But if you want to find out more, you got to figure out the whole story.
The story of what?
NO TIME... got to go!
Hi!
Got to feed my dog, and play cool music on my guitar! Thanks for your time!
(Yells after you) Oh and run! TIME AGENTS ARE COMING...
