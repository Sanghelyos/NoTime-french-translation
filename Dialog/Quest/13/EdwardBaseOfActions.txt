Who are you even?!
Who are you!!
Which ideas?!
I don't even know who you are man! (pauses) Oh wait.
You're that guy from university...
Listen I...
Ok BYE!
-------------
Woooooo! YEAH! Did we just travel through time?! (Pauses) Land on the Park Hill! Ah you should have been there, when my invention went nuclear.
Woooooo! YEAH! Did we just travel through time?! (Pauses) Land on the Park Hill. Remember? Where we set up the weather machine.
Alright! If you are ready let us get out.
So!
I, WE, just traveled through time... Wow! I, I tell you I really missed the green landscape... Well we may need a safe place to operate from. But first I am terribly in need of bardeys coffee. Yes, that is why we are in the 80s. Let's go get some coffee then shall we?
The car?
Don't worry! I do not think anyone will find the car here. Follow me!
...
I really missed a fresh morning breeze.
Hey the past is not too different. The town looks alright!
The church is still standing.
And there is the shop!
-------------
November 20th 1945. We got to save the prisoner. He is probably someone from a different time as well! Maybe he could aid us in reverting this timeline. (pauses) I wonder which family tree got erased completely. (sighs) I have no idea how to go about this though. Why have we ever invented this dreaded machine.
November 20th 1945 it is!
Lead on! No wait go and prepare the car. I just feel I need to do something first.
What is it?
I mean right now since we have the time. I think I would just like... to visit. The church (coughs) What? I just want to be a bit thankful for us making it out safely.
Have you changed in any shape or form?
Well being down there in the sewers with Michael. Well let's say he kind of made an impression on me, really. Besides We need some guidence, on how to fix this mess.
Okay.
I know! You are probably perplexed about what is happening right now. It will not take me long... let us go.
I will be at the church!
Do you need fuel for the reactor?
-------------
So?
You got some Uranium?
(Hands you the Uranium) Alright here! Remember that trader in the future? He can still supply us with fuel for the reactor. Once you are ready let us enter the time machine!
Some spare fusion cells?
(Hands you a fusion cell) Alright here! Remember that trader in the future? He can still supply us with fuel for the reactor. Once you are ready let us enter the time machine!
I think I am fine thanks!
Alright then! Remember that trader in the future? He can still supply us with fuel for the reactor. Once you are ready let us enter the time machine!
Let me set the date to November 20th 1945 at 04:00 AM. We can be there before Crimson arrives himself. To plan ahead.
Shall we get out?
Alright to business!
So! Fort Dun, as it is called, is just west of our position
What's next?
We head towards the fort!
We got to be secretive about this.
Yeah... If they are not alarmed they would not be expecting us... After all they must think we did not survive that blast (pauses) Well then.
Alright sure.
Alright! Let us take the road that goes from here right to the fort, west of here... Lead on! I know a lookout point in the area, I designated the destination on your map! An old watchtower of sorts in front of the castle.
So?
And the car?
Stop worrying! They don't even know we survived the blast, presently.
Let's meet at a lookout point! Just west of Sandy Cave! I marked it on your map! That tower. You will see!
(Walks up) Here we are. Let us review the plan.
Here we are. Let us review the plan.
(Whispers) There is the fort. I tell you, it likely is full of agents. I know that there are two ways. By a cave entrance that is to the left looking underneath the fort, or by the main entrance. I would go for the main entrance.
And you're crazy.
No I mean it really! (whispers) I mean really.
(Whispers) What way shall we take?
The main door of course.
(Whispers) I see we think alike. Now follow me quick!
We take the cave entrance to the left.
(Whispers) What ever you think is better... lead on.
Alright!
Err can you look away for a moment please.
(Whispers) So here we are! Now to my plan... Err, turn around for a second please.
Alright!
Alright! You can turn back.
May I introduce myself. Sir Edward Reuel Ath... err Scott!
This better be working.
You will see. Let me knock at the door. Just play along.
No words now!
(Whispers) Let us take the way to the right upstairs quick! Lead on!
(Whispers) You see that tower to the left? I bet the prisoner is kept there. We can jump over from the roof.
Jump over. I will follow soon after.
Hey guys!
Have you lost it?!
I had to confront Crimson. Listen we will talk about this later alright? I will take them with me. Let me use this mobile time device. We will meet on. let us say april 3rd 33AD at the bandit cavern. We will make everything ready for your arrival. Hope you make it out safe
Greetings travel. ah sorry. Hi!
Where have you been?
Let us just say I wanted to visit my distant relations and got stuck for about a year or more. I missed you guys.
Hi!
Just after you risked capture?
Captured by who?
Hi!
Crimson.
Oh, yeah... well. I had to find out what his grudge against me is about, besides it played all into my plan.
Greetings travel... ah sorry. Hi!
That could have gone very wrong.
I know but hey here I am. So now that we have time. Let us think of a plan. May I have leave to go to the blackboard?
We will need this tracker. Ask westwood if he remembers where exactly this mansion was. Oh and two more things.
What else do you need?
It is about the training bot and the other device... I will need a radio, two packs of metal parts and a magnetometer. I guess in the 80s the 6/12 should be still opened. And the tracker, that westwood mentioned of course.
Hey.
What do you need again?
I will need a radio and two packs of metal and a magnetometer. I guess in the 80s the 6/12 store should be still opened. Oh and ask westwood if he knows more about where to get the tracker.
The place looks cozy.
Aye! Stay here for a while if you need some rest from your hard work. I hope you know that we are aware of the huge help, that you have been in all this.
So what your feud with crimson about?
It's not my feud! Remember that Mr. Coffee we made? The infinite coffee maker. We got assigned that by our senior professor. Well I guess the idea at least came from crimson. I mean we did not steal any plans from him, it was just an idea. I guess it is not the only problem he has.
Great. I can always count on you! Now that we got all we need let us begin.
Alright!
Alright now to business.
Got the things? Place them on the table!
What do you need again?
I will need a radio and two packs of metal and a magnetometer. I guess in the 80s the 6/12 store should be still opened. And we need to get a tracker.
Alright land inside sandy cave. It is east of the fort. Look into your map in case you cannot find it.
Oh hey you made it! (pauses) I am so glad to see you guys.
You're scary.
(Pauses) Now all ready? Can you step back a bit please.
Look at what I found! A portable time device like the agents use! May be handy!
You know what! Meet me at the car. Don't wait for me. I need to do something real quick!
Wow! It is Clint Westwood! Is it true that you really captured 20 bandits single handed while carrying the boss on your back?
Wow! It is Clint Westwood! Is it true that you really captured 20 bandits single handed while carrying the boss on your back?
(Rubbing his back) There is no such thing as chance. We came for you.
Our adversaries. The evil time agents!
Thank you.
Currently.
We are.
In 33 AD!
I confronted their boss, Mr. Crimson! He's also pretty nuts.
....Well apparently he was a former student, who went to the same class as I did.
I don't know what went wrong but apparently he thinks I ruined his life over stealing his work for graduation.
I know this sounds crazy, but this is why he seems to hate me at the very least.
Anyway, now that they know we are alive! As intended.
They must be looking for us like crazy. Seeking again, for a chance to catch us.
This is why.
We must let them find us.
Reading from their documents you, Clint were crucial in changing the timeline.
Your family tree was erased, making it possible for crimson to come to power without any investigations done by your great grandson.
But if I were to bring you back to your time, they would no doubt recapture you again.
Except we lure them into a trap.
Hmm...
We may need some kind of tracker... To send a signal!
Then we will need to distract them a while!
With my...
Training bot!
Then we...
Enable...
A device sending a virus to all of their time machines!
Sending them into a distant future!
They will never get back since the virus locks them for ever onto that set date!
The only thing I do not know how to get is a tracker device!
Really?
Alright great! We need to get it then (Turns to you) Can we talk?
---------
Yes?
Finally! I thought we would get totally drenched!
Are you expected?
Indeed! Tell your master that, Sir Edward Reuel Scott and his assistant have come to observe the tapestries!
Tapestries?
This is a castle is it not? There are tapestries!
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. Wait here let me call for my master!
How dare.. err splendid!
---------
Just a minute!
It dawns on me only now... Why did we make this infernal machine? (Sighs) Let's get to the car.
You know, now I am wondering. How in the world did the Remnant get this big altar underground, into the room by the kitchen. Anyway to the car!
---------
You know I missed a nice cup of bardeys.
Ah well... So! To business!
Let us see what these files are about.
Hmm it speaks of a prisoner... (Reads)
Alot of historical events, which they changed to result in the current deviation of the timeline!
The documents speak of setting up a secret base in case of an emergency... (thinks) I guess in case we escape.
Here take a read! (Takes a sip of coffee)
---------
The Way goes ever on and on.
Right from the door where it began...
Now wide afar the Road has gone,
So I must follow, if I may...
Pursuing it with weary feet,
Until it joins some larger way,
Where many paths and errands meet...
And whither then? I cannot tell...
---------
Welcome. What can I get you two?
A coffee for us two please. Mine with extra sugar and no Milk! (Says nicely) Thank you.
Alright here!
Take yours from the table and let us sit down somewhere.
