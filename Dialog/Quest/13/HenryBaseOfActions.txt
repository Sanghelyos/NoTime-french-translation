It is you! What are the chances!
Put your nose into the wrong business again?
Yeah I was enquiring on the strange activities of fort dun, when these agents came up again and locked me up here! Good to see you buddy. Lead on! We need to get out of here! Wait. What is that comotion outside at the courtyard?
Wow it is you! What are the chances.
You put your nose into the wrong matters again?

Err who is that?
...that's Edward. Nevermind his outfit.
Err, Alright?
Ok.
We need to get you out of here!
Alright! See? But wait there is another prisoner we have to save.
Ok.
Another prisoner?
Yes he is kept in the underground level of this tower.
Let us go that way then!
I will lead on. That is the way we were dragged in, in the first place.
O hey there!
Where is Edward.
Ah he traveled to some time period. He should come back any time. Could you let Westwood know so he could come back? He said he was going to the small hill just to the west. You can see it from the cave exit, right where this rock is.

But, why?? Wouldn't that be counterproductive, see?
But , how?
I see!
Okay... what's a training bot?
