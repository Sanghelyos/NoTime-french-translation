Excuse me I am documenting something. See?
Listen you need to get away right now!
(Exhausted) Had a bad day?
What?
People will come after you.
After me? For what?
Well what are you doing here?
I found this weird device stuck to the monument, see?
Yes?
Hey let's leave this place. Want some coffee?
You will not let go, will ya? (Thinks).
(In shock) Well I guess you need to explain!
I am from the future.
Wow!
You were documenting their secret.
Well thanks for helping me buddy.
I will get me some coffee.
You should vanish from this town.
Alright. I will go back to my family then. I guess you could take care of that thing on the monument then? Thank you, thank you stranger from The Future!
