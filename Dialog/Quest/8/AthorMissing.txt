Hey you're back!
I rescued Henry. Then I found this device.
Wow that is indeed interesting. Hmm it seems to be damaged. This device is able to create a mini time tunnel. Maybe they are trying to create stable time portals!
Hey you're back!
I rescued Henry. Then I found this device.
Really? well where is the device.
...
Time portals?
I think that was the backup plan they were referring to, Operation Hydra Eye. They will try to take over space time from many entry points...
Could you put back that thing please?
This does not sound good at all.
It seems damaged but is still sending a signal. I may reverse engineer the signal and use the time portal to create a tracker of sorts for any other devices.
Could you put back that thing please?
Are you in?
Sure but where do i find them?
Hmm I have this sensoric device... Lemme see...
One moment please.
Yeah?
Alright! Here. I just attached the portal to the device and calibrated the frequency to that of that weird portal device. Don't loose it. Let me write you down the frequency dates. You need to recover them, otherwise they will take over the whole of SPACE and TIME!
