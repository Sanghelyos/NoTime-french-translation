(Sad) Hello stranger be your name?
What is it sir?
I have lost something really precious recently.
Can I help?
Unless you can take it up with some bullies. One has a gun! I would not want that on you.
(Hopeful) Good Luck stranger!
It's Time err... Guy.
I am the bane of ruffians.
Oh me? Just a stranger...
(Sunk into thought) I see... strange name I have to say.
You deal with ruffians you say! I might actually need your help!
Well stranger it be then...
I see what I can do.
Really? Well, Good Luck! They should be in a cave not far from here. If go past the hill behind my homestead, heading south, you will enter a flat valley. You will spot a huge rock, shaped like the front of a ship, from a certain point of view... Inside there is a cave, that is where the bandits are hiding! Here take this club! Beat them up tight for me boy! Good Luck!
(In awe) You're a marvel! Thanks!
You're welcome.
You know what! Take this key. It opens the door to the mine right behind the house. Some glowing ore, maybe you can make something of it!
Report back to me once you got my precious clock back! ...Place it on the table.
Greetings!
