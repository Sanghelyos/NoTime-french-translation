Mr. Crimson
I am not done yet!
...
After this little interruption of yours, our allies will finally establish open control over the whole world! First will the Apostasy and then we will launch our wars in the middle east, which will carry over into other countries. Weakening the whole world! Ready for our great leader to step in, as the saviour of humanity!
Here we go again.
Vatican II was only the beginning... This way we will put a wrecking ball to the entire western civilisation! This last bastion in our way will fall soon like a rock in the sea.
I know. And implants, one world bank.
Yeah! How'd you know that?
You said that already.
(Disgruntled) Yeah... when?
Never you mind.
(Thinks) I see... Well now that you are here. Let us test your time core and see if it works. (Chuckles) And all this we will do away with you
This is not the end!

I knew it! My younger self got the message!
Ho, Hold on.. where are you going?! (looks at you)     ...You!
Agent come back here! Hey!
Hey!
Heeeeeyyyy!!!

A voice
Leave him!
Is that how you treat people who come to visit our nice undersea shelter?
Please. Step forward!
I am so sorry for the inconvenience.
Our defense units overreacted a bit.
