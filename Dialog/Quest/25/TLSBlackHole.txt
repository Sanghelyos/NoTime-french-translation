(Turns to Edward) I have long planned my revenge on you.
Ever since you ruined my career. You stole my ideas!
You will pay for all you did to me!
(Sighs).
Initiate the process!
(Looks at the agent) Here take the access key and store them away in the archives!
No...

(Tries to get free) Nooo!
Arrrgh!
(Chuckles) Good bye Edward. (pauses) Comrades! Let's go to the observation chamber.
Sir err, were we supposed to initiate the time travel sequence?
No! Fool! I meant the warmup sequence!
Arrrgh!
