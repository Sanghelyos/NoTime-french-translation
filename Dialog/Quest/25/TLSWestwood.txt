What is the situation pal?
(Leave).
Woah, I ain't just going to let ya walk outa here.

Officer, I haven't done...
Some time ago, Edward R. Athor conspired against Mayor Crimson. He got caught eventually when trying to sabotage one of his energy plants. And then your name fell. Yes we have you on record.
What now punk!?
Well, I may be friend of his.
You mean you are. Now I invite you to my office for an interview.
Ah what ever.

I know what you're thinking.
Did he fire six shots or only five.
To tell you the truth in all this excitement I've kinda lost track myself.
But being this the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow the boogers under your nose clean off.
You got to ask yourself one question.
Do I feel lucky?
Well do ya?
PUNK!?
Arrgh!
Hurry!
(Turns to you and nods)
Go get him pal.

Now I am off, I need to catch your older friend...
