Aight! Land here! On the bridge! And let's get out!
We are in the 80s! Again!
Ye olde times.
We need to make the car seaworthy!
Alright!
Woah.
Yes! We will need to get some resources but here is the thing!
What?
My younger self is also here in 
.
Oh yeah.
You will need to go there and visit him. He will need to help us! But he will not be allowed to see me! Meet me behind the 6/12 store once all is done, I will take a stroll through the 80's!
You need to talk to young Edward! He needs to help us in upgrading the machine! Lemme take a stroll through Pine Lake meanwhile, I missed this town. Meet you later behind 6/12.
So what is the situation?
No Edward in sight.
Err my younger self?
So what is the situation?
Your younger self.
Oh. Where is he I wonder. Anyway my magnetometer fried during our last stand at the CORE. I'd need one from the store... If there are any there. Hey lets go there together.
So what is the situation?
Alright!
Follow me!
Hey buddy!
Thanks man. What's up with Henry?
Remember that the timeline has changed! He never went through our adventures in this timeline. To the car now before Clint spots us again! It is at the bills mechanic place! I will meet you there.
To the car already!
This is the plan!
What is next?
Before we left the dismal future, I managed to print out a plan of the entire deep sea base facility from the CORE. Here is an overview. (Prepares himself for a speech).
This is the plan!
Yes?
Here (Hands you over the plan) Here is the overview. We will have to split up down there, where the red cross is. The hangar is vertical so you will enter the hangar from underneath the floor. Your path is marked as orange, while mine is green. We will need to... (being mindful of bill) ...err, enter a special program each marked point and later meet up again to escape with the car. Yes.
This will stop their time machine?
(Stares wide eyed at you) Shhh! Yes, the clock device... It should at the very least make them, late, for a while. It is the best we have. We will basically... get into the core of the device by loading my own program into it, which will make them believe that the machine worked, but the err, (Raises eyebrows) the sequence simply was not achieved!
And this will stop err device?
(Nods strongly) Yes, Yes! The device err... (mindful of bill) it should at the very least make them, confused, for a while. It is the best we have. We will basically... get into the core of the device by loading my own program into it, which will make them believe that the machine worked, but the err, (Raises eyebrows) the sequence simply was not achieved.
Okay!
You have the two orange dots on each side of the accelerator. Unlike our training bot, this one is split into 3 huge Core mainframes. You will simply need to input the datachip into the two, which I will give to you later!
But how do we get down there.
(Grins) Our friend bill here transformed the car into a submarine! A few sealing plates here and there, I did some work on it too! He replaced the window with the sturdiest he had. I hope this will suffice.
Let's get going then!
Alright! There is one thing, the anti air cann..(breaks off) err... is active there. So first we need to deactivate that thing.
So how will we do it?
We must not fly or dive before the system is deactivated. That thing... is just north of cape dun. You need to get to the place and deactivate it from the control panel.
Let us do it then.
Alright! Into the car!
Good job man. As always you show your expertise Now it is time. To dive. The deep sea base is right beneath the sea of Cape dun.
Red lights. Do you see them? The docking area must be right beneath.
(Pauses) The window! It is cracking!
This won't end in a good way.
We survived, we made it! Thanks be to God.
We just lost our time machine!
Alas, the glass wasn't strong enough... But we did not loose the time machine per say! As you can see I managed to rescue the Core. Good thing I made it water tight. As long as we have this, we can always remake the other parts.
Well, we made it!
What is the plan now?
Lead on. The corridor down to the left. Then we will need to split up.
Alright! Here we will need to split up!
So.
Good luck friend.
Let us do it then.
You need to take the corridor and then the ladder up through the vents. There would be a way right up to the data core. Remember there are two cores.
Alright!
Here is the chip. Don't loose it. Remember we will meet at the end point of the accelerator. No worries you will find it. God be with you.
...
Good job man! Now the next core. I unlocked the door for you!
---------
Oh hey buddy, great to see ya!
You're wounded!
(Joking) Yeah, you I noticed?
Hey.
We can still escape, I can help you!
(Sighs) They used my time core, that, saved us from the cataclysmic event. But now we have that black hole. It will devour this whole station, (Pauses) or simply explode. They launched all escape pods on this level. (Sighs and fades a bit) You don't have the launch codes by any chance?
I have!
Show me!
(Pauses) You need to, scan the card through the slide...
(Pauses) Press that red button.
...
You're loosing your mind. You're coming with me!
There is one thing I have not told you. They were holding my younger self in the upper quarters where they were keeping me. They nearly threw me into the same cell as, me... That would have been disastrous. You need to save yourself and, my younger self.
I won't leave you here.
Someone needs to keep the hole closed as long as may be for you two to escape. I checked, there is one escape pod left on the up..., upper level (pauses and sighs) The tunnel behind us leads you right... Up there.
Besides, we both know that only one of me can go. I was young back then, my younger self will have still so much to make right again!
I have had my chance for a long life and have made my peace with God. I understand now (Cheers up) I understand that it is not about me fixing the past. I am too small a deal, to be able to fix such big problems. Let's leave this up to the big guy, maybe? I believe he will make it all right again. I am dying anyway so what good is it, now?
(Shed a tear)
I won't say don't cry buddy, for not all tears are bad. I made right what I could, ...in the time that was given to me. My younger self needs to learn that yet. Can you please knock. Some sense into him for me? (aches in pain) I needed the temperance to learn, to live with past failures, not reverting the past after it already went broke. You know that was the actual reason why I wanted to make the time machine. To change personal choises.
(Smiles) Hurry...
I will do that.
Thank you for having been such a good companion. See you on... the other, side... See you around, kid. (sighs of hurt) You need to hurry. There is no time.
(Dozes) Oh most precious.. blood... Most precious, Christ... Have mercy.
Oh hey it is you!
We need to get going.
Err... everything alright?
So?
I will tell you later.
Let's get going. The escape pod there is still boardable!
Well... what a story.
(Pause) Yes.
Where is the time machine?
Well.
Gone... it is destroyed.
You are stranded, then? Lost in the tides of time.
I, can't return anymore.
I am sorry... I really am. This must be awful, to be stranded in a timeline you never knew or lived in. No more chance to repair it all (Sighs).
Could you not build one?
(Chuckles and shakes his head) No, I am sure that me from your timeline was the biggest genius on the whole island. But I, I am just an inventor trying to survive. Some of my inventions work, but I don't know anything about temporal physics you see. (Pauses for a moment) What was it, that you wanted to tell me earlier?
I lost a good friend down there. He saved us.
He did. (sighs) I am sorry to hear that. I hope you did exchange a few last words together.
I could have said more, but there was no time.
(Pauses and sighs) I guess nothing can be reverted now.
We tried to fix the past so many times...
...
We made it out so many times, but not this time.
(Sighs).
And now I am here.
Well you saved the future, this time maybe for good. Although you may be stranded in a time.
In the end, he entrusted it to a higher power.
(Assures) He did the right thing I believe. Let the force, which governs above our universe repair the course of this terrible adventure.
Yes.
Err, hey I, I think I got to ask you something strange.
Huh?
Yeah... when was the last time you had a dream? I believe in all the hustle you had no time to really rest.
The last time I dreamt?
Yeah...
-----------------
You better had made some progress by now!
Edward, but.
(Sighs) Tell me you finished the reactor!
I did, but...
Awesome! Come on now! There is little time, our supervisor will show up soon, we need the machine to be ready.
Machine?
The time machine. Come on now, we got no time!
...
Is this a joke? We had this already.
We had what?! You're confusing me buddy. Grab the reactor and follow me to the elevator.
(Looks proud).
...
It, it is a Mach 3! Come on buddy. I modified it to reach speeds of up to 90 miles per hour!
Ok listen. I, I guess I had a dream.
We all have it at times!
All this happened. And then the agents came!
Agents?
They tried to seize the time machine!
...
But I managed to escape with it!
Oh wow, but what happened with me?
I reunited with you in the distant future of 2014!
Oh? Did they have flying cars? I wonder.
Yes! Yes they did!
Wow. Ok I think it was a dream then... You had me worried for a second.
What?
Flying cars... I only wish that was true. Now I see you inserted the reactor already... Lemme do my part now!
Flying cars... I only wish that was true. Now take your reactor and insert it into the reactor slot into the car!
Now it is my turn.
Well there goes the time core. This didn't happen in your dream?
No... it did not.
You know let us take a break... Forget that thing for now!
Well there goes the time core. This didn't happen in your dream.
What about the agents.
(Assuring) Buddy, do not worry it was a dream, a nightmare at that (pauses) Wait... I... I remember something.
Well there goes the time core. This didn't happen in your dream.
You remember what?
I remember the future... It all went wrong... I died. And then... (Looks at you) You got to tell me everything. From the start. You know what, let's get us some donuts from Ben's while at it.
...
Alright! (End No Time).

The time core!
(Tries to insert the core) Come on get in!
Arrgh!
(Sighs)
---------------
May I present to you my newest and hopefully final attempt!
(Sighs) Follow me, we take the staircase.
Hey... Hello?
Open Up!
Hello?!
Finally! Have you been sleeping on the floor again?
--------------
Hmm seems sealed shut!
Which reminds me...
I found that laser back where they kept me.
Could have been my invention.
Come on inside!
Get Ready!
Sweet Mary and Jesus...
Take me in...
The last time was...
...
...What a terrible nightmare.
----------------
Good! I guess that worked.
...
I will, (pauses) hold it. Go!
You have been a good friend you know.
Sweet mary and jesus... Take me in.
------------------------------------
(Whispers) Great! Let me open you the next door!
I am at the third core. I, hold on someone is coming...
---------------------------
Well, that was the car.
Come on! (Pauses) Got it!
(Yells) Watch it!
(Waves you to follow him).
Magnetometer... hmm.
Great, exactly what I needed!
No Magnetometers... you don't happen to have one at hand do you?
Well buy it... then. I will wait.
Awesome! Good job!
Let's go!
I will stay here for a while. I need to gather my senses. See if my younger self is now back at the lab!
