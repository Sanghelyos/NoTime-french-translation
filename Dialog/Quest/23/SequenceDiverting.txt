There it is! Just as you said it would...
This is some kind of bunker... an entrance?
The date is set 1989! Fly through the tunnel and accelerate to 70 miles per hour!
Good bye Training Bot...
I am starting the accelerator! Wait to see if the polarisers move. Then come back, let's get this thing going.
Come on over!
Hold on. Be there in a minute...
Accelerator system is booting...
Accelerator is active!
Hold up!
You made it! Get up here!
-------------
Guys!
The great leader is approaching! For his treasure...
We will have to go underground!
We will blow the facility and the CORE. It is too dangerous! If they manage to capture it... Goodness knows...
Aye.
I will redirect the areal units, to hold them off. To buy you time to escape...
Flee. You must move now! We will manage it!
Ok... (Turns to you)
Goodbye. I hope we will see each other again... Good Luck!
-------------
Alright we are here!
...I need to see the car now!
...This ain't good at all!
-------------
Jason!
We managed it Michael! (turns to you) But it is not over yet!
-------------
It is jason! The CORE has been disabled for good!
(Shouts) Protect the citadel!
(Shouts) Too many of them!
(Shouts) The CORE, they shut down all robots!
-------------
Michael! Sir!
They've sent an artillery tank! It is approaching from the south road!
Then we need to move! We will manage it!
(Turns to you) Quick move to the outpost at the southern road! Good luck! Stop that tank!
(Talks through comms) Alright, come to the city ASAP! ...It is Jason, we will talk about him later...
-------------
[Exclamation] T-2 minutes...
[Exclamation] T-1 minute...
[Exclamation] T-10 seconds.
-------------
You did it!
Jason can you check the entrance in case of any threats?
Ah what ever...
[Exclamation] Master! Edward. Reuel. Athor.
(Blushes)... what?
[Exclamation] I presumed you <Deceased>.
How?
[Answer] Administrator Crimson <Deceased> Proclaimed you dead. [Question] How may I serve?
Deactivate all AI units roaming around. Deactivate them!
[Question] Would you like to deactivate squadron 1#, squadron 2#, squadron 3#...
... No all of them!
Wow... what was that?
They must have destroyed the weather machine!
[Attention] I cannot order 58% of the defensive forces until their task is completed.
What was that blast? I can't reach Michael! The comms are out.
Training bot, err... What task did you give to the units?
[Answer] Protect CORE <Me>; Terminate location #12 <Pine Lake Center>. 200 units have been deployed. 23% of the units have been sent to this location.
...
[Exposition]You have 3 Minutes till they encircle this location.
We are trapped! Just as the agents before us!
Is there no way you could help us?
[Information] Processing... [Answer] There are 5 mobile turrets stored in a locker behind me;
[Answer] The Magnetic Accelerator Tunnel, could deploy a lethal current, but the C units are not affectable.
Why dont we just escape?
Don't you get it, we are surrounded! Besides we can't just let them retake the CORE after all this!
Let's move we got no time! Quick grab some turrets. They will be coming from every side.
Prepare the turrets... man!
They are going to be here soon... (Anxious).
Take heed, these turrets only shoot what is in front of them!
They are coming...
There is too many of them!
Jason! To the northern wing!
Fall back! ... Fall back! To the tunnel!
I think, we are winning!
Yeah, we showed them!
The elevator! Behind!
(Talks through the comms) Hey Michael! We lost your connection!
(Talks through the comms) Yes yes! We took the core... Alright on our way!
(Turns to you) You need to hurry... Michael and the town is under attack. I will stay and take care of Edward first. Quick! Oh and stay safe!
Use that elevator, it should lead right up! I will try to reason with that CORE.
---------------------------
I am firing MY LASER! Maximum power!
(Struggles) Turn on already! STUPID LASER!
(Hurt) ARRGH!
Edward!
Edward! Hey!
The laser must have emitted some kind of electromagnetic pulse!
(sighs) My head.
Hey man, we made it.
---------------------------
Great! you made it again!
Well! How do we procede now?
We cannot storm in all at once, the CORE may have some tricks up its sleeve!
One of us has to go then!
(Smiles) Can you do it?
---------------------------
So, this is the COR.. (Breaks off)
Training... what?
Is that my training bot? (Shocked) No What have they done?
...
Tell me you didn't clean up our trap in 33 AD!?
Did you?!
---------------------------
What are you two talking about?
What is that pencil doing on the ceiling?
No administrator in sight... hmm.
...must have been long dead, since.
I get it... it is a PENCIL, see? Administrator P.E.N.?!
Oh this is just, dumb.
What did you expect from artificial intelligence? It's in the word ARTIFICIAL.
AHH I know what is to be done next!
Right! So we need to terminate the administrator, err pen.
This way the CORE might recognize it as terminated and would not act further.
Alright let's do it. But why not destroy the CORE itself?
It may become useful, err later on.
Let us go further down that path, it may lead to the entrance for this chamber!
-----------------------------
What, is it blocked?
A dead end?
No...
Get behind me, I will cut through it!
This is crazy, you just nearly killed us before with your crazy laser torch!
I will take a safe distance as to not get melted.
Nervous? Out of character, perhaps?
...
Get behind!
Well look at that!
I will try to climb down.
What is this place?
(Whispers) I know this place reminds me of something, but...
(Whispers) My first guess would be some kind of circular, magnetic field generator.
(Whispers) Anyway, let me cut open our next exit.
Hey, are you coming?
Let's climb up...
Alright we are clearly going somewhere.
Let us find that CORE, and track down this administrator.
-----------------------------
...
I guess this was an elevator... At some point.
We go down.
I go first, he goes second and you last.
... This is insane, no one of mind would climb this way down.
See it is simple. There is no other way. We came that far.
...
Just think about this, we are standing on ground, down there is also ground minus a small distance.
(Turns to you) You go after him.
What is it with you? Suddenly so out of character.
Now you guys...
Awesome, now move down slowly. Watch your hands... Don't let go.
Come on now Edward!
----------------------------
(Shaking but sturn) Lord help me...
(Sturn) Who hath made heaven and earth!
Let's get it moving!
(Shaking) beáte Maríae semper Virgini, beáto Michaéli Archangelo!
Did Michael teach you this?
(Mumbles to himself, shaking)... Sanctis Apóstolis Petro et Páulo, ómnibus Sanctis.
Et vobis, fratres.
M, m m Mea Culpa!
The rope!
(Yells) Move faster!
Mea maxima Culpaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Aaaaaaaaaaa  ... Owww!
Oww, my back. My Back!
We... we made it! Hahaha!
(Turns to you) Will you take the lead?
Agents...
----------------------------------------
The door is closed... Jason does the Robot know a way out?
(Talks through com) Hey... it is me again... Does the robot know the interior data of the bunker?
The CORE abandoned this segment all together as they use a different entrance.
Weird that this robot head knew the essential password for the entrance to the bunker, but not information about the bunker itself.
I guess this is it then. Hold on.. what are you (Breaks off).
Stop it! Or you are going to cut us in half instead!
This is not what I expected.
(Sarcastic) Great.
(Turns to you) Can we talk?
----------------------------------------
Rrrright?
Or left?
------------- there is a space after least... keep it
Dude...
This stuff is at least 
 years old by now.
This tastes pretty good.
Eww!
I have had worse.
I once ventured into the sewers as a youngling. Then I stumbled, and fell!
Ever drank sewer water?
(Shakes his head in disbelief)
-------------------------------
Right it is.
Nice goggles!
-----------------------------
A terminal!
This place looks to be man made.
It was constructed before the great cataclysm.
Terminal: Enter Password...
Hmm... err.
(Exhausted) I don't know.
I guess I better call up Michael.
(Talks through com) Hey.
Yeah we are having some problems.
No a gate, that needs a password.
I know we are not inside yet.
(Sigh) Can't you just question the robot for a password?
The pass is 2CanPie.
Alright here we go.
(Turns to you) After you!
