I have this. It is an EMP device. Use it only in case of us encountering many of these robotic things!
Thank you.
Hurry. Michael needs you now!
We need to get back to the CORE, Edward is waiting. I will meet you up on the towns reactor, right above us, land on it with your car. We will need to take it too, so he said.
What is he up to?
He did not want to specify. But he mentioned that Leader is approaching with his fleet. We are blowing the CORE.

Then let us move on.
(Turns away) Michael you need to evacuate the town. We need to move east now!
Where is the car?
We will land at the bunker exit. Where that elevator leads out!
Land on that platform!
Let's get out when you're ready.
Good bye man. I don't know if we will see each other in the future, but stay safe you two!
You too buddy!
