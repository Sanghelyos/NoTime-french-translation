You should visit the church. It is one of the few churches that still celerebrate the old rite.
There where these stories of the ACCORDION MAN. You would not want to meet him in the forest at nights.
Hi?
Hi!
I don't know you... Who are you...
There is this dude guy. You better don't knock at his door.
Remember what was fortold in fatima? A bigger war would happen after WW1 if people would not turn from offending God. A strange unknown light was fortold to make the night birght before the war. And see what happened. A gigantic Aurora Borealis and right afterwards WW2!
