What happened? Everything is on fire! I think that wasn't me... I need to go on and find Edward!
-----
Edward and I concluded to split ways. He will distract the agents and the flood gates open so I can escape through the tunnels! There is one though which I will need to open up. There is an activation trigger just on the balcony next to it.
I had to, I mean. I had to escape with the time machine. Who knows what these agents would have done with it. I hope Edward made it out safe. We decided on getting the machine far and hidden. Maybe in time? I always wanted to visit the distant future of 2014. But in order to do that I will need to take out that mod chip above the time table first.
Ok I think the car is safe for now, let's talk to Edward
Edward gave me his newest PLC. A few bugfixes and so on. Let's talk to Edward.
I opened the gate!
