Ok... I need to go back to the 80s and talk to Edward's younger self. It would be better to talk to him after I first talked to him, in order to get to the past.
-----
Alright let's talk to Edward, right after I last met him in the 1980s. I should have the date entry still on my PLC
Edward wants me to meet up with him inside Sandy Cave. From there we will take a hike and scan out the region. I should leave the car behind. Edward said there was an anti air gun places on the mountain. I should avoid triggering it.
I got to search the guards for any vital information.
I need to deliver these vital notes to Edward back in the future.
