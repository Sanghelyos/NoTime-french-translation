Alright let's see where to find the Athors. They should live next to the hill.

I need to get that heirloom clock back. Those bandits have been residing in a cave. I should head southwards past Athor's homestead and the hill. Reaching a flad field where I should be able to spot a huge rock shaped like the front of a ship. There I will find the cave. I should watch out the guy who stole the clock has a gun.
