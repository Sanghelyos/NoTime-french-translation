I need to get young Edward to aid us in transforming the time machine into a submarine! But, he cannot, he must not see his older self though!
-----
Edward seems not to be at the lab. I need to report back to old Edward behind the store.
I need to get back to the car. Edward left it at Bill's mechanic shop.
I need to deactivate that anti air turret. Edward told me to not to fly or dive with the car or the turret will catch us. Once at the turret I need to deactivate it via accessing the control panel.
I managed to deactivate the anti air gun... Now it is time to dive in deep. The base is located somewhere outside of Cape Dun. Deep under sea.
We made it into the base! But we lost the car. That wasn't part of the plan! For now we need to venture on.
I infected the first core. Now I need to go on and insert it into the second core tower.
I infected the second core with Edward's program. The way ahead should lead me to our meeting point.
Hmm... Edward is not here. What now?
It is the agent with the access card. If I have that I can return and close the gate! I need to catch him!
That was close... The agent must have run ahead. I need to catch up.
I will have to escape this place but Edward decided to stay behind. I need to save me and Edward's younger self. I need to go to the upper levels.
The story might be over. But there are still things to do...
Edward, he got badly wounded he is loosing alot of blood...
The PLC took some heavy damage. Where am I, when am I? The laser must be forming a sort of time tunnel. Where one exit creates another entrance... I need to head on, east in the direction of the laser.
It is Crimson, again...
It is Henry! He can surely help me out of here.
I need to find a magnetometer for Edward. Hopefully I can find one somewhere around.
I need to see if young Edward is back at his lab... the other Edward is staying behind at the church.
