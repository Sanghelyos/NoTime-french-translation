Where am I? A prison cell? Where is Edward I hope he is alright...
-----
Edward and I got split up. We'll have to regroup in the sewers. Let's hope I can somehow find him there. Stinking sewers...
We decided to split in order to find a way into the city. Athor said to meet him back at the crossing if I find a way through the sewers.
We decided to stick together whilst venturing through the tunnels. We need to find a way into town.
Alright I need to find a way out. Let us hope this won't go wrong.
Alright I need to find a way out.
We found a secret hideout of people who seem to have organized a kind of secret remnant of past citizen. Athor needs a magnetometer in order to make a way into the city.
We were spotted by a kind of hovercraft. I guess it would be better to travel underground from now on.
We escaped!
