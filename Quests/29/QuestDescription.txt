Detective Westwood, is trying to uncover the mystery behind the shooting, on February 11th, 1923, behind the national bank at night, presumably after 6pm. His suspect won't talk now but maybe I will be able to spot him during that event. I should observe from a distance and confront him him afterwards.
The agents fled the scene. I need to capture Adriano! I heard him speaking of some note he was carrying! He ran away somewhere in the direction of the future bookstore, were the hotel is.
I need to persue Adriano!
Adriano gave up an envelope from the Don. But from here what will I do? Will I break the seal and take a look at what is inside, will I hand it over to Westwood, or maybe I will try to find Don, down in the sewers, were his speakeasy is located and give it back to the Don. I will need the password in order to get in.
I read the Don's message. The don has written the entry word to his hidden speakeasy.
Some dude saved me, I only heard his voice echoing through the halls of the sewers. He told me to meet him on park hill.
So, here I am. Where is this guy?
This Cococrab Man wants me to halt the conversation between the Crimsons and Rampones for as long as possible, till he takes them out. Their meeting will happen on the Roover Dam, which is south of Mount Uroruh, on the February 28th at 0 in the morning.
I aided Coco Crab Man, and apparently Detective Westwood in capturing Crimson and preventing them from dealing out the deadly weapon. I should talk to Coco Crab Man, in order to conclude this endeavour.
The crime activities between Rampone and Crimson have ended safely, for now. Coco Crab Man said he would find me, if he would need me again.
