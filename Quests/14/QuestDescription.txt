Westwood told me a mansion was situation on the slopes of the mountain, in the northern parts of the island. He was supposely held underneath there. He also remembers them talking about 1975. I could look if there is any suspicious mansion around the mountain in 1975... Then get one of these trackers they have been working on.

This place looks awfully suspicious. Time agents... I think this is it. Let's find a way in.
There has to be some secret entrance of. There might be a hidden trigger of sorts to open it.
This looks like a secret manufactory for trackers. I need to find a key to get inside the chamber.
Well at least I made it... The agents likely set of the detonation, as a last ditch. I should look for the tracker amongst the remains...

This did something...
I got the tracker!
