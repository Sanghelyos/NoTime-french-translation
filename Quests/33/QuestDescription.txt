Edward wants to meet me with the car at midnight on the northern shores. There is a marker of our meeting spot on the map.
Did Bernd not say the ship would appear from the corner of our eye? What did that mean?
Ok let's not lose sight of that ship. Seems to appear or disappear once looking the other way. Let's take the car and pick up Edward. And land on it.
Ok I need to retrieve information from the ship's data core. That way we may find out what happened to this island and to the ship itself. I mean it can teleport and fly... not what I call normal. I got this phasing device from Edward, this will make it possible for me to switch between an older version and the present version of the ship. Could come in handy.
Nice! So apparently this ship served as a conduit to transfer information between some Kraken Base and a nother underground base underneath Uroruh. There is a mountain entrance east of Fort Dun, I need to report to back to Edward on Jupiter.
