Ok... What ever happened to Pine Lake, I need to find help for Edward first.
-----
Michael asked me to talk to Jason. He should be inside the barracks right now.
I need to bring at least 5 units of provisions (food,drink,...) to Jason, to fill up his stock for a short while longer. I can find Jason at the storage area beneath the landing platform in Pine Lake.
I brought Jason the food he asked for.
Jason will quickly speak to Michael. Let's check out if Edward is alright.
I should go and meet Edward at the church...
Edward wants me to check out the old office of Mr.Crimson, which has been built on top of the courthouse. He handed me a key to access it. I need to find out anything which may lend us info on the whereabouts of the CORE.
I have it now. Something called The Aurora must hold the information on the location of The CORE. But what is The Aurora? I need to inform Edward asap.
Mr. Crimson we allocated the necessary processing power to Kraken Base. We will continue to oversee the completion of the CORE from The Aurora.
Bernd spoke of a ghost vessel appearing at midnight between two rocks on the sea, off to the north coast. I need to let Edward know and meet him there.
