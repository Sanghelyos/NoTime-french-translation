I heard of a dude, who supposely lived here in the 50s. If I happened to knock on his door back then... What ever that means.
This bisque guy wants me to get him a life supply of crab meat from a monster crab. He told me that I can find out more by reading a mythical creatures book at the library store. I should prepare myself accordingly, a monster crab does not sound like an easy hunt. In case this doesn't work I might just give him maybe a stack of dozen crabs.
I defeated the giant crab! Now I need to bring the lifetime ration of crab meat to the dude.
