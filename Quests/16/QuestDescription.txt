Edwin Athor mentioned a kid went missing, maybe I can help. He also told me to search for clues in the old forest nearby. He warned me that he saw him late at night. Then he also gave me a chant to aid me if all else fails.

This place is awfully quiet
There I saw something! Or someone? Where did he run? Somewhere in direction of the ruins I think. I need to follow.
There are ruins marked right ahead on the map. I should take a look there.
The Accordion Man Mystery may not be solved. But the kid found its way back to his parents.
I heard rumors about an illusive Accordion Man from the 70s.
I should take a hike to the town archives at the courthouse in Pine Lake. Maybe I will find out more... -b-But from there on I think I have to find the clues on my own.
I heard rumors about an illusive sightings in the old forest. Maybe I take a look and see if someone lives close by. I heard that Edward's grandfather lived in the 70s, close by the forest. I may ask him.
I am always welcome at Tom's house...
