Edward needs me to get him-b- one cake mix pack-b- a pallet of eggs-b- milk and strawberries. I will need a mr. crafty. Hopefully I would be able to buy it in 6/12.

Edward wants me to meet him at the main square...
Edward will take care of the agent I should report back to Michael.
I will have to attend the questioning of the agent down at the Under City. It is right where the old hideout of Michael and Jason's Remnant group, in the first alternate future was located...
Edward wants me to meet him at his lab.
I should check on Edward, I think he ran in direction of the northern town gate.
