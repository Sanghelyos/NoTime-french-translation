I guess, I hope that in the future there is a younger version of Edward to help out. I should visit 1984 again and search for him. I should keep the note with me. Might come in handy.

Ok here we are! The 1980s! Let me just check if the town is still alright.
Ok err no. The future does not look familiar at all. I need to find Edward in 1984 as fast as possible.
This is not alright. Not at all... But lemme find Edward first. Maybe he is not at the lab but in town. Given that so much has changed I do hope that he is somewhere around.
Ok! Alright I need to meet Edward behind the courthouse where the parking lot is.
Edward wants me to demonstrate the time machine in action. I need to jump a short while into the future.
Alright I made the jump. Let me talk to Edward.
I need to meet Edward back at his lab.
Edward wants me to get a component unit from a radio. He wants me to harvest these spare parts in order to build the override chip for 300BC.
Edward wants me to meet him back at the parking lot behind the courhouse. Before I leave for 300 BC I should definetly get some provisions or a lamp for night walks, just in case.
Ok I got the chip from Edward. Now I just need to put it into the slot inside the car. And then off to 300 BC!
I made it to 300 BC!
