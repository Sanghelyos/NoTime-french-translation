E.R. Athor would like me to get -b-- revolver parts from the 1880s-b-- a magnetometer from the 6/12 store.

I need to build that gun with mr crafty which I got from Athor and test it afterwards in the backyard where he put up a target.
He could have warned me that thing was dangerous. Anyway I'd better talk to him now.
