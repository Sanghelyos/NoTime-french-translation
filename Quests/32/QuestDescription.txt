I, I think the future is alright... Edward is his old self again, I guess. Though he and I remember things that no one would believe. He told me to meet him back at his shop. He is planning on dismantling the machine.
Edward lost some blueprints, they were probably scattered around the shop's proximity during the raid. He is missing about five blueprints still. They have to be somewhere scattered around his shop.
I helped Edward find the rest of his blueprints. He said he had a letter for me. Weird. Let's see what is in it.
