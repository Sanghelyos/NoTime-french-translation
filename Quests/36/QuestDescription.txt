I've encountered the strange and illusive Camodo! He ran away... or rather flew away. Somewhere in direction of mount uroruh. He must have landed at the mountains peak! I need to take up the persuit!
And there he went. Although I cought up to him, I am still none the wiser, he was very cryptic. And he asked me to figure out the story... when I asked him what story, he just responded that he got NO TIME.
