E.R. Athor wants me to get a hoverconversion for the car.
-----
So now that I got the hoverconversion, E.R.Athor wants me to meet him at 2 AM at his shop.
I need to meet him on top of the courthouse. There seems to be now a parking lot up there.
Alright let's talk to him when the the other me is not around. No need for substantial paradoxes.
I got to upgrade the car with a miniature fusion reactor by making it with mr crafty. And then meet Edward back in his shop.
I need to meet with Edward at the school Class Room A. He wanted to gather some of his old stuff from there and explain the plan to me in the same time.
Hmm the workshop seems alright. But Edward is away, what does this note say?
Edward searches for an old news piece of a missing person from the 1940s here at the archives. Let's see if I can find it amongst the other files. It should be still around.
