I read the tragic story of the high hill men. They apparently lived some time in 1584 on the slopes of mt. Uroruh, above or at the water fall.
I met Erombur one of 5 hillmen, probably some relative of Edward's no doubt. If I wanted to join their feast at the campfire he said, I should bring two coconuts lying at the beach. That's going to be a bit of a hike.
Let's have a seat at the campfire with the other hill men.
There was a scream coming south east from the hillmens cave. I was given the task to scout in that direction. In case of any problems I would have to report back immediately. If something happened I should hoot twice like a barn-owl and once like a screech-owl, I don't know how make either sound...
Giants! Well boogers, what now. I think I really should report back to Jano quickly, or I can try getting closer, to find out what they might be up to. If I do, I'd have to sneak my way closer to them.
Jano told me to report Fort Dun! We are going to lure the bandits into a trap! Let's go to the cave underneath the fort!
We defeated the giants and the lord of Cape Dun has invited us for a feast! Let's follow him into the dining hall.
That's what I get for being involved in this. Now I and the other hillmen are imprisoned for something we haven't done... what now? Time for an escape plan perhaps...
I aquired a prison key from the guard and gave it to Hansel. Let's attempt a break out!
We made it out. Jano said we would all meet up back at the cave, where we would consider the next course of actions.
The story is over. All ended well. Since this story actually inspired hansel to write a story on this... I wonder if it will change. All the same I find it interesting that they want to establish a mine a year from now in the cave. I could check it out...
I got seperated from Jano and the rest... I hope they will make it out fine. I should perhaps try to go to back to the hillmen cave, that is where they will likely head to if they make it out.
