Now we need to find a way into this tower. This is where we will find the time machine for sure.
-----
The side door is locked. I guess we need a key. Edward thinks they may have a key at the guard house next to the pizza place. If it is still a guard house.
Edward wants to find something in the archives, that could explain this curent state of things. Something useful or important.
We found some useful files. Maybe they will help later in figuring out this whole situation. Let's venture on upstairs.
We found the time machine! Now we need a way out. Edward noticed a mechanism up there. To the right.
I have been captured again.
We need a keycard in order to open the door to the mechanism that could toggle the gate to the car. Edward thinks they must have escaped with it upstairs. Maybe they have the keycard.
Edward thinks the guard, we encountered on the landing platform, may have had the key to the room.
Athor broke his laser device We will need to find another way.
We opened the gate! Now for it!
