Here I am, now all I need to find out is where the pirates are hiding out, who are treasuring the medal. Maybe the locals will know more. In any case I should be smart about this, since it may be an entire pack of pirates to deal with.

I found the pirate base. The guard won't to let me in though unless I pay him 200 shillings.
I have now access into the pirate camp. I need to find this medal.
I have gained access to the pirates ship!
I need to meet Rhogur to the east of the pirate camp. He wants to raid the ruin there. In any case it will help me to get closer to the pirates... and possibly find out where they hide the medal. In any case I should get a light source for these ruins will be likely very dark.
We made it out! I need to talk with Rhogur.
I should meet up with Rhogur back at the ship, in the pirate camp.
I don't think I will be received happily again into the pirate camp...
Now or never. I need to get that medal.
Rhogur wants me to meet him in his quarters... I think this may be my chance to get the medal.
I got the medal! Now back to Edward!
