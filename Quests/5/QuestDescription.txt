Alright I need to go to June 7th, 1989 and get into the facilty. Retrieve the plans for the dimension case from some kind of safe and get any tangible information on the intruder's plans. I should avoid Edward at the same time.

I managed to retrieve the blueprint!
I managed to find out the secret plans of these suspicious time agents. Some supervisor with the letter C, I suppose...
Alright... I got the things which I came for! Let's get back to the future!
I need to throw or shoot at that microwave. Better at a distance. This should revert the timeline!
I did what I needed to do. Let's meet Athor back in the future...
I think this fixed the timeline. Let me get back to the future...
Ok the facility is just behind the courthouse. The car should be somewhere safe so the agents won't find it. Afterwards, let's see how to get inside.
Apparently those guys are for the plans too. I should take care of this.
