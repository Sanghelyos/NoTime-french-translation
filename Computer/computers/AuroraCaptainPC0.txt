Dear Diary, today I dreamed about cheese. I don't remember when the last time was I took a shower. Is the sky always blue? How did I manage to pass first grade without ever being able to write or read... Oh and I should take care of the lower deck leakage. A few more days and the floor from the Core Room will cave in!
