History tells that Prince Berend of the southern archipelago first discovered the island in 1490. 

His life was filled with adventure. And so after his battles with the pirates, his venture onto the continent, to aid his friends during the war and his marriage with princess Luthiana, he decided to settle down there in the little village of Cape Dun.

A hundred years later would the city of St. Andrey to the west be established.
