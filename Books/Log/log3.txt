Silence that MDM visionary. Make the introduction of our pawn pope happen. Force the other one to resign, or else eliminate him. He endangers our plans!

Today is a glorious day! Our comrade will now take over administration over the vatican. This will be the gateway to WORLD DOMINATION.

We must work fast, so that our own new "pope" to "dies", so he can be revived "miraculously". Our great leader will then proclaim these "wonders" once he revealed himself to this feeble world in jerusalem. Then we will initiate our one world religion! Our one world economy! Our one world leader! Get ready my fellow comrades to give them a great show Muhahahahaha! (Evil Laughter).
