<MR. FALLONE>
[Stirrs in order to get up and leave]
I have 2 children and a wife, I need to keep up. I cannot stay.

<DETECTIVE>
Oh, not so hasty Mr. Fallone. You haven't been in any relationship, at any recent time. So far as I can know. I will of course make good what was wronged against you, in case you do have a family to take care of. You have my promise.

<EXPOSITION>
After a series of investigations no further ones were initiated. Neither the full extend or the reason behind the murders were found out. Mr. Fallone returned home to his family when his wife came to plead his release.
