because if you suffer for Me, in Me, with Me, you are chosen. Pray, pray not to submit to his reign of terror...

...Let Me hold you in My Arms; cradle you with My Divine grace, now, to give you the strength to fight for the Truth. My Love for you will never die.

Jesus Christ, King of My People
Saviour and Just Judge
