(To prepare for the Warning)
Crusade of Prayer (24) Plenary Indulgence for Absolution

â€œO my Jesus, You are the Light of the earth. You are the Flame that touches all souls. Your Mercy and Love knows no bounds.

We are not worthy of the Sacrifice You made by Your death on the Cross, yet we know that Your Love for us is greater than the love we hold for You.
