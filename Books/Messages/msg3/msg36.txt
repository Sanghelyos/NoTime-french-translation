Grant us, O Lord, the Gift of Humility, so that we are deserving of Your New Kingdom.

Fill us with the Holy Spirit, so we can march forth and lead Your army to proclaim the Truth of Your Holy Word and prepare our brothers and sisters for the glory of Your Second Coming on earth.

We honour You. We Praise You.
