Those good souls who love Me will also suffer for many of them will be also be stained with sin but they will receive instant Absolution. 

They too, will be humbled, when their sin of pride is shown to them.

Many will stay indoors for some days afterwards and many will have to fend for themselves because of the lack of services.
