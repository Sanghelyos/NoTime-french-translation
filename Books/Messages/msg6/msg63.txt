"...I Am the Light.
Without Me you will remain in darkness.
I love you no matter how you may hurt Me or offend Me."

"I Am Real. I Exist. I love you and I will never give up My fight to save you so that I can take you, your family and friends to the New Paradise on Earth.
This Paradise was created for Adam and Eve and will now return to Earth.
I want you to be part of this new glorious life, which is beyond your dreams.
 
I bless you now.
Your beloved Friend
Jesus"
