Try not to be fearful for such a persecution can be faced fearlessly.
Once you prepare well by following My instructions and keeping in daily prayer the time will be swift.
Trust in Me always.
Remember I died for your sins. It is only fitting that you allow Me lead you in this time towards the New Kingdom on Earth.
Only I, Jesus Christ, can lead you. Remember that without Me you are nothing.
Your Jesus
