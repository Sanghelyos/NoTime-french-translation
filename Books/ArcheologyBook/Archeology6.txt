Chapter 6:

Viking Village

To the north of fisher bay are very old remnants of an abandoned village. Unearthed objects from that place seem to be of norse craftsmanship.

The archeologists found the village to be the likely famous colony of King Ragnar. It is unknown what happened to them. To all accounts the colony was abandoned after a short amount of time.
